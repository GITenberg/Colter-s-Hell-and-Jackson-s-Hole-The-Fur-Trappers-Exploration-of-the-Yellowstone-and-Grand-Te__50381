</div>
<h2 id="c1">I. Strange Land of &ldquo;Volcanoes&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shining Mountains&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Yellowstone-Grand Teton region was not officially
discovered and its scenic marvels were not publicly proclaimed
until the 1870&rsquo;s, beginning with the Washburn-Langford-Doane
expedition. For thirty years before, from
1841 to 1869, this region was a Paradise Lost, rarely visited
by white men. But for thirty years before <b>that</b>, or from 1807
to 1840, this region had hundreds of appreciative visitors.
These were the Rocky Mountain fur trappers. While searching
for the golden-brown fur of the beaver, destined for the
St. Louis market, these adventurers thoroughly explored
this fabulous region. Although news of their discoveries
received scant public notice back in the settlements, or was
discounted as tall tales, to them belongs the honor of being
the first actual explorers of these twin parks.</p>
<p>Neighboring Yellowstone and Grand Teton, established
as National Parks in 1872 and 1929, respectively, are separately
managed today as units of our National Park System.
But geographically, now as well as in the early nineteenth
century, they embrace one unique region, characterized by
topographic and geologic features that are the crescendo of
a great scenic symphony. Here, at the heart of the continent,
the source of the three major river systems of the
continent&mdash;the Columbia, the Colorado, and the Missouri-Mississippi&mdash;may
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
be found the greatest geyser basins, the
largest mountain lake, the most colorful of kaleidoscopic
canyons, one of the richest arrays of wildlife, and one of
the most spectacularly beautiful mountain ranges in the
world. The Yellowstone-Grand Teton region has historical
unity, also, particularly during the obscure but heroic age
of the Rocky Mountain fur trade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo;&mdash;bearing the name of the legendary
discoverer, and conjuring up visions of a primitive &ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s
Inferno&rdquo;&mdash;is the term which visitors today associate with
the early history of Yellowstone National Park and its universally
famous hydrothermal wonders. Actually, the wandering,
bearded, buck-skinned beaver trappers never referred
to the geyser region of the upper Madison as Colter&rsquo;s
Hell. As we will see, the real Colter&rsquo;s Hell in Jim Bridger&rsquo;s
day was another place altogether, having nothing to do with
anything within Yellowstone Park itself. In trapper times
the Yellowstone geyser area had no fixed name but was
variously described by them as a region of &ldquo;great volcanoes,&rdquo;
&ldquo;boiling springs&rdquo; or &ldquo;spouting fountains.&rdquo; On the recently
discovered Hood and Ferris maps (see below) it is labeled
&ldquo;the Burnt Hole&rdquo; (although this name seems to have been
restricted by Russell and others to the Hebgen Lake Valley).
Captain Bonneville tells us that his men knew of this region
as &ldquo;the Firehole&rdquo; and this name, as applied to the river
draining the geyser basins, survives today.</p>
<p>Yellowstone Park, carved out of territorial Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho, is a rough-edged rectangle of 3,500
square miles that straddles the twisting course of the Continental
Divide. It is a geological circus, a unique creation
of ancient volcanoes and glaciers, flanked on the southeast
and east by the Absaroka Range, on the north by the Snowy
Range, on the northwest by the Gallatin and Madison ranges,
on the west by the Centennial Range, and on the south by
the Teton Mountains.</p>
<p>From the Park flow the headwaters of two continental
rivers and their major tributaries. From here the Snake
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
River arcs southward toward Jackson&rsquo;s Hole and the cathedral-like
Tetons, destined to join the Columbia River and the
Pacific Ocean. Here the Firehole and Gibbon rivers, draining
the principal geyser basins, unite to become the Madison
River, and here also arises the Gallatin, these being two
of the Three Forks of the Missouri. Here arises a branch
of the North Fork of the Shoshone River, a tributary of the
Bighorn. And here, after its birth near Two Ocean Pass,
begins the mighty Yellowstone River which, after passing
through its vast mirror-like lake and its prismatic canyon,
flows out onto the plains to receive the Bighorn and join
the Missouri on its marathon journey to the Mississippi
River and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>This region held a fortune in coveted beaver skins, but
it was remote, snowbound, haunted by the vindictive Blackfeet,
and plagued by weird visions, sulphurous fumes, and
uncanny noises. Here indeed was fertile soil for a legend.</p>
<p>On a clear day Yellowstone Park visitors can see to
the south the mountain spires which identify Grand Teton
National Park of Wyoming, an indefinable shape of 500
square miles. (The actual boundaries of these neighboring
parks are separated by a scant five miles.) The Tetons are
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
perhaps the most distinctive of the granite giants which
comprise the Rocky Mountains. A series of sharp pyramids
of naked rock, the peaks stand like sharks&rsquo; teeth against the
sky. The most precipitous sides and the most needle-like
summit belong to the highest of these, the Grand Teton,
which rises over 7,000 feet from its immediate base, nearly
14,000 feet above the level of the distant sea.</p>
<p>The Teton Mountains are the most conspicuous landmarks
of a region which contains the scrambled sources of
the three greatest river systems of continental United States.
As we have seen, Yellowstone Park to the north gives birth
to the eastward-flowing Missouri and the westward flowing
Columbia waters. East of the Tetons, in the Wind River
Mountains, is the head of Green River which rolls southward
to merge into the mighty Colorado River, tumbling
through the arid lands to the Gulf of California.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s Hole is that part of the Upper Snake River
Valley which lies at the eastern base of the Teton Range.
One of the largest enclosed valleys in the Rocky Mountains,
its glaciated floor extends about sixty miles north and
south, and varies up to twelve miles in width. It is bounded
on the west by the Tetons, on the east and south by the
less pretentious Mount Leidy Highlands and the Gros Ventre
and Hoback Mountains. The Gros Ventres merge imperceptibly
into the Wind River Mountains farther east, the
crest of which forms the Continental Divide. The southern
extremity of the Tetons merges with the eastern end of the
Snake River Range near the canyon where the Snake River
escapes from the valley.</p>
<p>Historic Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, also known as &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Big
Hole&rdquo;&mdash;but now politely refined to just plain Jackson Hole&mdash;was
named in 1829 for David Jackson, one of the partners
of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. To the early trapper
a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; was a sizeable valley abounding in game, and
usually (with the exception of Yellowstone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Firehole&rdquo;)
associated with some distinctive personality&mdash;hence Brown&rsquo;s
Hole, Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, Gardner&rsquo;s Hole, etc. However, Jackson&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
Hole was more than just a pleasant spot for trapping
and camping. Research gives substance to the view that
this was the historic crossroads of the Rocky Mountain fur
trade.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s Hole was destined by geography to become
a traffic center of the Western fur trade. Between South
Pass at the head of the Little Sandy and the northern passes
above the Three Forks of the Missouri it offered the most
feasible route across the Rocky Mountain barrier. In addition,
it was the focal point of a region that was highly prized
and vigorously contested because of its populous beaver
streams. Here trappers&rsquo; trails converged like the spokes of
a great wheel and, after Lewis and Clark, most of the important
trapper-explorers crossed Jackson&rsquo;s Hole on their
journeys.</p>

<p>In historic times there were seven gateways to and
from Jackson&rsquo;s Hole: northward up Snake River; northeastward
up Pacific Creek to Two Ocean Pass; eastward up
Buffalo Fork to Twogwotee Pass; eastward up the Gros
Ventre to Union Pass; southward up the Hoback to Green
River; westward via Teton Pass or Conant Pass (at the south
and north extremities of the Teton Range) to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>The Tetons received their name from French-Canadian
trappers who accompanied the earliest British expeditions
into this territory. As they approached the range from the
west, they beheld three towering mountains upon which
they bestowed the name of &ldquo;Trois Tetons&rdquo; (&ldquo;Three Breasts&rdquo;).
This romantic designation was readily adopted by the lonely
trapping fraternity to whom the sharp snowy peaks (now
known as the Grand, Middle and South Tetons) became a
beacon to guide them through the hostile wilderness. To
the Indians the Tetons were variously known as &ldquo;The Three
Brothers,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hoaryheaded Fathers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tee Win-at,&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;The Pinnacles.&rdquo; The earliest Americans in the
region, being more practical than romantic, could find no
better name for the silvery spires than &ldquo;The Pilot Knobs,&rdquo;
while an official Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company map indicates with
equal homeliness, &ldquo;The Three Paps.&rdquo; The name &ldquo;Three
Tetons&rdquo; survived, however, and was officially recognized by
cartographers. The name first appeared publicly in the
Bonneville Map of 1837.</p>
<p>The Upper Snake River (i.e., above the mouth of Henry&rsquo;s
Fork) was called &ldquo;Mad River&rdquo; by the Astorians. Others
simply referred to it as the &ldquo;Columbia River&rdquo; or &ldquo;the headwaters
of the Columbia,&rdquo; but to most of the fur trappers
it was &ldquo;Lewis River&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lewis Fork,&rdquo; so originally named
in the Clark Map of 1810 for Capt. Meriwether Lewis, as
Clark&rsquo;s Fork of the Columbia was named after his fellow
explorer, Capt. William Clark. This name was much more
appropriate than its present one, which is derived from the
Snake or Shoshone Indians, and first appears on the Greenhow
Map of 1840.</p>
<p>In spite of past efforts by water power advocates to
&ldquo;improve&rdquo; it by a dam, Yellowstone Lake remains just as
it was when first discovered by John Colter, the original
&ldquo;Lake Eustis&rdquo; of the Clark Map of 1810. Jackson Lake,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
however, was enlarged by a dam built in 1916 by the Bureau
of Reclamation. This lake is identifiable with the &ldquo;Lake
Biddle&rdquo; of the Clark Map of 1810, the &ldquo;Teton Lake&rdquo; of
Warren A. Ferris, and the &ldquo;Lewis Lake&rdquo; referred to frequently
by another trapper, Joseph L. Meek. There is
today a tributary of the Upper Snake known as Lewis River,
heading in a Lewis Lake within the confines of Yellowstone
National Park, neither of which are to be confused with the
historic &ldquo;Lewis River&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lewis Lake.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c2">II. The Mystery of &ldquo;La Roche Jaune&rdquo; or Yellow Rock River</h2>
<p>For some twenty years before the advent of Lewis and
Clark, French-Canadian voyageurs of the North West Company
were in league with the Mandans, and from these
Indians learned of the distant &ldquo;Pierre Jaune&rdquo; or &ldquo;Roche
Jaune&rdquo; River, a translation from the Indian equivalent of
&ldquo;Yellow Rock River.&rdquo; Chittenden theorizes that the ultimate
origin of the name descends from the brilliant and
infinite varieties of yellow which dominate the color scheme
of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and which probably
awed the first aboriginal explorer just as it does today&rsquo;s
auto-borne tourist.</p>
<p>Although there is room for debate as to whether any
of the Canadian traders beat Lewis and Clark to the mouth
of the Yellowstone, it is certain that one of their number
preceded the Americans in the approach to its headwaters.
On September 10, 1805, Francois Antoine Larocque reached
&ldquo;Riviere aux Roches Jaunes&rdquo; just below the mouth of
Pryor&rsquo;s Fork, near present Billings, Montana, in the course
of &ldquo;a voyage of discovery to the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo; After
wintering at the Mandan villages in 1804-1805 as a neighbor
of the hibernating Lewis and Clark, and being thwarted in
his desire to accompany them upstream, Larocque had returned
to his post on the Assiniboine for supplies, then
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
hurried back to the Mandans, going from there overland
via Knife River, the Little Missouri, and the Tongue to the
Bighorn Mountains, country of the Crows.</p>
<p>While wintering with the Mandans, Captain Clark
sketched two maps of the unexplored country westward,
based on &ldquo;the information of traders, indians and my own
observation and ideas.&rdquo; One of these shows &ldquo;Rochejhone
River&rdquo; with six tributaries from the south, five with Indian
names, two translated as &ldquo;Tongue River&rdquo; and &ldquo;Big Horn R.&rdquo;
The Bighorns and Rocky Mountains beyond are represented
only by diagrammatic strokes. There is a trail from the
mouth of Knife River to the Bighorns, roughly the same
subsequently taken by Larocque. This was actually a refinement
of a sketch made for Clark by the Mandan Chief
Big White. The second map shows &ldquo;River yellow rock&rdquo;
minus tributaries but with the Crows (&ldquo;gens de Corbeau&rdquo;)
located just west of an imaginative &ldquo;montagne de roche&mdash;conjecturall.&rdquo;
These maps, the first to our knowledge to
depict the Yellowstone River, were sent to President Jefferson
on April 7, 1805, by Meriwether Lewis, to accompany
his eagerly awaited progress report.</p>
<p>Upon their return trip in 1806, after wintering at Fort
Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia, Lewis and Clark
divided in order to explore the country more thoroughly,
the latter undertaking to determine the source of the mysterious
Yellowstone. On July 15, with eleven white men,
the Indian woman Sacajawea and her baby, the cavalcade
crossed Bozeman Pass, which marks the divide between
the Yellowstone and Gallatin Fork, and reached the vicinity
of present Livingston, Montana. Never suspecting what
wonders lay concealed behind the snowy mountain wall to
the south, Clark hurried on down the river to rejoin Lewis,
with glory enough for one expedition.</p>
<p>There is only one hint of volcanic phenomena which
Clark seems to have obtained from any source other than
the presumed conversation with Colter, mentioned below.
This was an Indian tale, received after Clark&rsquo;s return, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
before Colter&rsquo;s return, to the effect that at the head of
Tongue River, a branch of the Yellowstone, &ldquo;there is frequently
heard a loud noise like Thunder, which makes the
earth Tremble, they state that they seldom go there because
their children Cannot sleep&mdash;and Conceive it possessed of
spirits, who were averse that men Should be near them.&rdquo;
Speculates Vinton, &ldquo;it can hardly be doubted that the Indians
referred to the geyser basin in the Park,&rdquo; rather than
to the Tongue River neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that, prior to Colter, no white
man had knowledge of strange phenomena on the Upper
Yellowstone, this supposition being one of the pillars of the
&ldquo;first-discovery&rdquo; theory. It is fairly evident that Clark
knew nothing of geysers when he was within seventy-five
miles of them in 1806 but, ironically enough, at this time
some intimation of them had certainly reached others, including
Clark&rsquo;s sponsor, Thomas Jefferson. On October 22,
1805, James Wilkinson, governor of Louisiana Territory,
with headquarters in St. Louis, sent to the President, in
care of Captain Amos Stoddard,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a Savage delineation on a Buffalo Pelt, of the Missouri &amp;
its South Western branches, including the Rivers plate &amp;
Lycorne or Pierre jaune; This Rude Sketch without Scale
or Compass &lsquo;et remplie de Fantaisies ridicules&rsquo; is not destitute
of Interests, as it exposes the location of several important
Objects, &amp; may point the way to useful enquiry&mdash;among
other things a little incredible, <b>a volcano is distinctly
described on Yellow Stone River</b>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wilkinson apparently obtained this primitive map from unidentified
traders. It could not have been a copy of Clark&rsquo;s
map sent from Fort Mandan the April previous, for it obviously
contained new data. In an advice to Henry Dearborn,
Secretary of War, dated September 18, 1805, Wilkinson revealed
that his interest in Yellowstone curiosities was sufficiently
aroused to dispatch an expedition of his own
upriver!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have equipt a Perogue out of my Small private
means, not with any view to Self interest, to ascend the
missouri and enter the River Piere jaune, or yellow Stone,
called by the natives, Unicorn River, the same by which
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
Capt. Lewis I find since expects to return <b>and which my
informants tell me is filled with wonders</b>. This Party will
not get back before the Summer 1807&mdash;they are natives of
this town....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who were Wilkinson&rsquo;s explorers, and what became of them?
Who were the &ldquo;informants&rdquo;? Was their information firsthand
or derived from Indians who, unlike the Mandans,
were acquainted with details of the Upper Yellowstone?
These questions may be unanswerable, but they arise to
shadow the giant figure of John Colter.</p>

<h2 id="c3">III. John Colter, the Phantom Explorer&mdash;1807-1808</h2>
<p>The epic journey of discovery known as &ldquo;The Lewis
and Clark Expedition&rdquo; was organized in the autumn of 1803
at Maysville, Kentucky. Here, on October 15, John Colter
enlisted as a private with the stipulated pay of $5 a month,
apparently answering the requirement for &ldquo;good hunters,
stout, healthy, unmarried men, accustomed to the woods and
capable of bearing bodily fatigue in a pretty considerable
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colter shared all the hardships and triumphs of the
expedition, as well as routine adventure in hunting, starving,
Indian diplomacy, and getting chased by grizzly bears. In
August 1806 the returning party reached the Mandan villages.
Here Colter was granted permission by the explorers
to take his leave and join two trappers from Illinois, Forrest
Hancock and Joseph Dickson, bound for Yellowstone River.</p>
<p>The extent of the wanderings of this trio is not known.
In the spring of 1807 Colter alone paddled a canoe down the
Missouri to the mouth of the Platte where he found keelboats
of the Missouri Fur Company of St. Louis, led by
Manuel Lisa. He was promptly recruited and went with
this expedition up the Missouri and the Yellowstone to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
mouth of the Bighorn River, where Lisa built a log fort
known as Fort Raymond or Manuel&rsquo;s Fort.</p>
<p>It was from this point that Colter made his famous
journey of discovery during the autumn and winter of 1807-1808.
Colter left no written record of his own. The only
thing resembling written evidence is the following by Henry
Brackenridge, who heard it from Manuel Lisa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He [Lisa] continued his voyage to the Yellowstone River,
where he built a trading fort. He shortly after dispatched
Coulter, the hunter before mentioned, to bring some of the
Indian nations to trade. This man, with a pack of thirty
pounds weight, his gun and some ammunition, went upwards
of five hundred miles to the Crow nation; gave them
information, and proceeded from them to several other
tribes. On his return, a party of Indians in whose company
he happened to be was attacked, and he was lamed
by a severe wound in the leg; notwithstanding which, he
returned to the establishment, entirely alone and without
assistance, several hundred miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from this slim clue, his course can be determined
solely on the basis of &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Route in 1807&rdquo; and other
data which appear on William Clark&rsquo;s &ldquo;Map of the West,&rdquo;
published in 1814, presumably based on a conversation of
1810 at St. Louis, whither the trapper-explorer returned
after hair-raising adventures with the Blackfeet in the Three
Forks country. Inevitably, in view of the topographical
errors and distortions of the Clark map, Colter&rsquo;s precise
route is subject to wide differences of opinion.</p>
<p>A composite of theories offered by Hiram M. Chittenden,
Stallo Vinton, Charles Lindsay, and Burton Harris, to mention
only four qualified scholars who have undertaken to
hypothecate Colter&rsquo;s route, is that Colter ascended the Bighorn,
followed up the Shoshone River to near present Cody,
went south along the foot of the Absaroka Mountains, up
Wind River to Union Pass, into Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, thence probably
across Teton Pass into Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, thence north via
Conant Pass to the west shore of Yellowstone Lake and
northeast to the crossing of the Yellowstone near Tower
Falls, thence up the Lamar River and Soda Butte Creek,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
back across the Absarokas, thence south to the Shoshone
River, and back to Lisa&rsquo;s Fort by way of Clark&rsquo;s Fork and
Pryor&rsquo;s Fork.</p>
<p>The key to Colter&rsquo;s route is the identification of Lakes
Jackson and Yellowstone, respectively, as Clark&rsquo;s Lake Biddle
(named for the patron of his publication) and Lake Eustis
(named for the Secretary of War), no longer questioned by
historians. The &ldquo;Hot Spring Brimstone&rdquo; at the sulphur
beds crossing of the Yellowstone River near Tower Falls and
the &ldquo;Boiling Spring&rdquo; near the forks of the Stinkingwater or
Shoshone (see <a href="#c4">Chapter IV</a>) are other checkpoints which now
seem quite firm. In addition, there are two interesting
claims of physical evidence. While these are both necessarily
debatable and subject to challenge as hoaxes, they
deserve consideration. According to Philip A. Rollins,
quoted by Vinton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September of 1889, Tazewell Woody (Theodore
Roosevelt&rsquo;s hunting guide), John H. Dewing (also a hunting
guide) and I, found on the left side of Coulter Creek, some
fifty feet from the water and about three quarters of a mile
above the creek&rsquo;s mouth, a large pine tree on which was a
deeply indented blaze, which after being cleared of sap
and loose bark was found to consist of a cross thus &lsquo;X&rsquo;
(some five inches in height), and, under it, the initials &lsquo;J C&rsquo;
(each some four inches in height).</p>
<p>The blaze appeared to these trained hunting guides,
so they stated to me, to be approximately eighty years old.</p>
<p>They refused to fell the tree and so obtain the exact
age of the blaze because they said they guessed the blaze
had been made by Colter himself.</p>
<p>The find was reported to the Government authorities,
and the tree was cut down by them in 1889 or 1890, in
order that the blazed section might be installed in a museum,
but as I was told in the autumn of 1890 by the then
superintendent of the Yellowstone Park, the blazed section
had been lost in transit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second reputed Colter relic, which has survived, is
the so-called &ldquo;Colter Stone&rdquo; which is now exhibited by the
National Park Service in its new Fur Trade Museum at the
Moose Visitor Center, Grand Teton National Park. This is
a piece of rhyolite hand-carved roughly in the shape of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
human head, with the inscribed lettering &ldquo;John Colter 1808.&rdquo;
This specimen was dug up in 1931 by William Beard and
son while clearing timber on their farm about five miles
east of Tetonia, Idaho, just within the Wyoming state line.
In 1933 Aubrey Lyon, a neighbor, obtained the &ldquo;stone head&rdquo;
in trade for a pair of riding boots, and presented it to park
officials.</p>

<p class="caption">Colter&rsquo;s Hell today (with Superintendent Lon Garrison and wife).<span class="jr"> Photo by Author</span></p>
</div>
<p>Although the natural tendency to view such finds with
skepticism may be respected here, several factors lend
plausibility. Members of the Beard family had no knowledge
of John Colter. In 1931 the Colter story had not been
well researched, and the version then was largely confined
to the year 1807; yet if Colter made winter camp in the
Teton Basin, and left a record to help while away the
time, this would logically occur early in 1808. The stone
itself yields no conclusive evidence on the basis of wear or
patination; but some geologists agree that 125 years of
weathering and soil acidity could have elapsed between the
initial carving and time of discovery. At least the Colter
Stone is a great historical conversation piece!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>According to Thomas James, an associate of Colter&rsquo;s, the
fight with the Blackfeet, mentioned by Brackenridge as
occurring on Colter&rsquo;s Yellowstone journey, did not actually
occur until the summer of 1808, near the Three Forks of the
Missouri. On this occasion Colter was wounded in the furious
battle between the Blackfeet and Flatheads.</p>
<p>Still later in 1808 Colter and John Potts (another Lewis
and Clark veteran) were captured by Blackfeet on Jefferson
River. Potts was killed and dismembered. Colter was
stripped naked and told to run for his life. The Indians,
who were to have great sport with Colter in this way, were
enraged when he managed to escape his tormentors and
kill one of them. He finally made his way back to Manuel&rsquo;s
Fort, greatly emaciated.</p>
<p>After this fabulous feat of endurance, Colter remained
in the wilderness until 1810, when he guided Colonel Menard
to Three Forks, where a new fort was built, which was
subject to constant Blackfeet harassment. Vowing never to
return to the mountains, Colter returned downriver to St.
Louis, arriving in May 1810 after six years of perils which
well entitle him to claim as &ldquo;The American Ulysses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colter settled at the village of Charette, a few miles
above the mouth of the Missouri River, and married a girl
named Sally. According to Washington Irving, in 1811
Wilson Price Hunt of the Astorian expedition attempted to
persuade Colter to join him but this Colter declined to do
after &ldquo;balancing the charms of his bride against those of
the Rocky Mountains.&rdquo; In 1813 he died, ingloriously, of
&ldquo;jaundice.&rdquo; Thus passed the phantom discoverer of the
Teton-Yellowstone region, to whom James pays this tribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Colter was] five feet ten inches in height and wore
an open, ingenious, and pleasing countenance of the Daniel
Boone stamp. Nature had formed him, like Boone, for
hardy indurance of fatigue, privation and perils.... His
veracity was never questioned among us and his character
was that of a true American backwoodsman.</p>

<h2 id="c4">IV. &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo;: A Case of Mistaken Identity</h2>
<p>One of the most venerable old axioms of fur trade
history is that of Colter&rsquo;s Hell, which may be formulated
thus: &ldquo;After John Colter discovered what is now Yellowstone
National Park, he told others of the scenic wonders
there. No one believed him, and his listeners derisively
dubbed the imaginary place Colter&rsquo;s Hell.&rdquo; No item of
Yellowstone history is more widely believed, more universally
beloved, and more transparently incorrect.</p>
<p>There <b>was</b> a Colter&rsquo;s Hell in the fur trappers lexicon,
which referred specifically to an ancient thermal area bordering
the Shoshone River just west of present Cody,
Wyoming. The term was <b>never</b> applied historically to the
thermal zone within Yellowstone Park itself. It was Hiram
M. Chittenden, the esteemed engineer and historian who
first suggested this usage in 1895 with the original edition
of his book, <b>Yellowstone National Park</b>.</p>
<p>The earliest published reference to &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo; is in
Washington Irving&rsquo;s version of Capt. Benjamin L. E. Bonneville&rsquo;s
journal narrating events from 1832 to 1835. However,
note here that this &ldquo;volcanic tract&rdquo; with its &ldquo;gloomy
terrors, its hidden fires, smoking pits, noxious streams and
the all-pervading &lsquo;smell of brimstone&rsquo;&rdquo; was located, according
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
to Irving, not on the headwaters of the Yellowstone but
on the Shoshone or &ldquo;the Stinking River&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Stinkingwater,&rdquo;
originally named on the Clark Map. It was Chittenden
in 1895 and not Irving in 1837 who started the legend
by asserting vaguely that &ldquo;the region of ... [Colter&rsquo;s] adventures
was long derisively known as &lsquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell,&rsquo;&rdquo;
implying that by &ldquo;region&rdquo; he meant Yellowstone Park, the
subject of his book. He does not accuse Bonneville or
Irving of error, perforce conceding that &ldquo;this name early
came to be restricted to the locality where Colter discovered
the tar spring on the Stinkingwater,&rdquo; but he hopefully
guesses that &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s description, so well summed up by
Irving ... undoubtedly referred in large part to what he
saw in the Yellowstone and Snake River Valleys.&rdquo; This is
where the misconception got started.</p>
<p>It is significant that no historian prior to Chittenden
entertained this misconception. For example, in 1890 Hubert
H. Bancroft wrote: &ldquo;Far east of ... [the volcanic basins on
the Upper Madison], on the Stinkingwater Fork ... is
Colter&rsquo;s Hell, where similar phenomenon is exhibited on a
lesser scale.&rdquo; It is further significant that in his monumental
<b>American Fur Trade of the Far West</b>, the first
edition of which appeared in 1902, seven years after the
first edition of <b>Yellowstone</b>, Chittenden wrote that Colter
was &ldquo;the first to pass through the singular region which
has since become known throughout the world as the Yellowstone
Wonderland. He <b>also</b> saw the immense tar spring
at the forks of Stinkingwater River, a spot which came to
bear the name of Colter&rsquo;s Hell.&rdquo; This is his only reference
here to the term, which is a clear if tacit admission that
he was in error in the first instance to create the impression
that it ever applied contemporaneously to Yellowstone Park.
But the impression once created would not down. Like
Aladdin&rsquo;s wonderful lamp, the jinni was out of the bottle,
and the poetic version of &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo; has become a stock
item in Western literature.</p>
<p>Defenders of the Colter&rsquo;s Hell mythology are eager to
challenge Washington Irving as an authority. True, Irving&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Captain Bonneville by his own admission never personally
saw the Yellowstone Park area. Also, it is true that geysers
are not to be seen today along the Shoshone River. Hence
it might be reasoned that the only noteworthy thermal activity
in 1807 was likewise confined to the Yellowstone (more
particularly, to the upper Madison), and that Bonneville was
merely reporting a twisted rumor. But a cold examination
of the facts shows that Irving and Bonneville were correct.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/img013.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" />
<p class="caption">Colter Monument.<span class="jr"> Photo by Author</span></p>
</div>
<p>First, there is no good reason to question Bonneville&rsquo;s
geographical knowledge. While he never saw it himself,
Bonneville had quite a crew circulating through the future
park as early as 1833 and, in fact, there is reason to believe
that the great geyser basin of Firehole River, climaxed by
Old Faithful, was discovered that year by one of his own
lieutenants (see <a href="#c7">Chapter VII</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, although there are no phenomena readily
apparent to passing motorists at the bona fide and unmarked
Colter&rsquo;s Hell site just west of Cody, the evidence of thermal
activity, not entirely extinct now, is abundantly evident to
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
anyone who cares to pause enroute to or from Yellowstone&rsquo;s
East Gate. On the Canyon rim downstream from the rocky
defile enclosing the Buffalo Bill Dam, there are extinct
geyser cones up to thirty feet in height and an extensive
crust of fragile sinter. In the canyon floor itself there are
bubbling fountains in the river bed, and the same pervasive
smell of rotten eggs, (or more scientifically, sulphur dioxide)
which assails one&rsquo;s nostrils on the Upper Firehole. (Other
related hot springs once existed at the forks of the Shoshone,
now drowned beneath the reservoir).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/img014.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="541" />
<p class="caption">Colter Stone Find Site (Wyoming).<span class="jr"> Photo by Author</span></p>
</div>
<p>How very strange that this spot, quite evidently the
&ldquo;Boiling Spring&rdquo; of Colter&rsquo;s famous route on the William
Clark Map of 1810, has been largely ignored since 1895.
Campfire writers and lecturers have been so enchanted by
the Yellowstone &ldquo;Wonderland,&rdquo; they never gave thought to
this historical-geological feature 50 miles outside of the Park
boundary.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Bonneville wasn&rsquo;t the only one who knew about
the phenomena on the Stinkingwater. The true identity
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
of Colter&rsquo;s Hell was well understood by other mountain
men. In 1829 Joe Meek knew all about steam vents &ldquo;on
the Yellowstone Plains,&rdquo; but he also was familiar with a
volcanic tract on &ldquo;Stinking Fork,&rdquo; previously &ldquo;seen by one
of Lewis and Clarke&rsquo;s men, named Colter, while on a solitary
hunt, and by him also denominated &lsquo;hell.&rsquo;&rdquo; In 1852 the
famed missionary-explorer, Father De Smet, cited &ldquo;Captain
Bridger&rdquo; as the source of his information that, &ldquo;Near the
source of the River Puante, which empties into the Big
Horn ... is a place called Colter&rsquo;s Hell&mdash;from a beaver-hunter
of that name. This locality is often agitated with
subterranean fires....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stallo Vinton, early Colter biographer and editor of the
1935 edition of Chittenden&rsquo;s <b>American Fur Trade</b>, paid no
attention to Chittenden&rsquo;s footnoted correction of 1902.
Rather, he did more than anyone, perhaps, to exterminate
the true Colter&rsquo;s Hell and pin the name on the National
Park. He accuses Irving of a substantial error in locating
&ldquo;Hell&rdquo; on the Stinking River. Similarly, he ignores Joe
Meek&rsquo;s careful distinction between the Yellowstone and
Shoshone volcanic tracts.</p>
<p>In 1863 Walter Washington DeLacy accompanied a party
of Montana gold-seekers through the Yellowstone Park area.
Although his companions were too absorbed in the search
for the precious metal to pay any attention to the scenic
wonders, DeLacy, a surveyor by trade, did pay attention
and subsequently published a crude but illuminating map
of the Park region. Here the principal geyser basin on
Firehole River is called &ldquo;Hot Springs Valley.&rdquo; And far to
the east, near the forks of the Shoshone is a &ldquo;Hot Spring,
Colter&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; [sic] In 1867 the official map of the Interior
Department, by Keeler, apparently reproducing DeLacy&rsquo;s
data, also indicates a &ldquo;Hot Spring, Coulter&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo; [sic] So
the Federal Government, at this early date, gave this official
recognition to the clear distinction between the two thermal
areas.</p>
<p>Vinton refers to the DeLacy and Keeler maps but he
dismisses this further evidence as a mistake. Perhaps his
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
stubborn version of Colter&rsquo;s Hell would have collapsed if
he had seen the recently discovered Bridger-De Smet Map
of 1851, in the Office of Indian Affairs. Here Bridger also
clearly distinguishes between &ldquo;Sulphur Spring or Colter&rsquo;s
Hell Volcano&rdquo; on Stinking Fork and an entirely different
&ldquo;Great Volcanic Region in state of eruption&rdquo; drained by
Firehole River. (See <a href="#c8">Chapter VIII</a>.) Can we invoke any
higher authority than Jim Bridger?</p>

<h2 id="c5">V. &ldquo;Les Trois Tetons&rdquo;: The Golden Age of Discovery, 1810-1824</h2>
<p>In the spring of 1810, after Colter had departed, the
Missouri Fur Company fort at Three Forks was so besieged
by the Blackfeet that Andrew Henry was forced to flee
with his trappers southwestward. They crossed the Continental
Divide to the north fork of Snake River, since
known as Henry&rsquo;s Fork. A few log shelters built here near
present St. Anthony, Idaho, called &ldquo;Henry&rsquo;s Fort,&rdquo; became
the first American establishment on the Pacific slope. During
the rigorous winter of 1810-1811 it may be reasoned that
these men explored the country within a wide radius of the
Teton Mountains. Any belief that they touched Yellowstone
Park must be conjectural, but that they were acquainted
with Jackson&rsquo;s Hole is quite evident from the
testimony of the Astorians. In the spring of 1811 the starving
company disbanded. Henry and others returned down
the Missouri via Three Forks, while John Hoback, John
Robinson and Jacob Reznor went eastward via Teton Pass,
Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, Twogwotee Pass, and overland to the
Arikara villages on the Missouri, where they shaped a dugout
and proceeded downstream.</p>
<p>In 1808 John Jacob Astor secured a charter from the
state of New York creating the American Fur Company.
The most ambitious of his schemes was the establishment
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of a trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River, to
exploit the wealth of the Northwestern wilderness. To promote
this enterprise, Astor organized the subsidiary Pacific
Fur Company and sent out two expeditions, one of which
went by sea around Cape Horn, while the other was to
proceed overland along the route of Lewis and Clark. The
overland Astorians achieved fame as the first transcontinental
expedition after Lewis and Clark, but fate decreed
that they should blaze their own trail&mdash;through Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole.</p>
<p>Early in 1811 the overland party, under the command
of Wilson Price Hunt of New Jersey, left St. Louis and
sailed by keelboat up the Missouri River. On May 26, near
the mouth of the Niobrara River, they met Hoback, Robinson,
and Reznor. This trio was persuaded to join the outfit
as guides and hunters, and it appears that it was their
reports of hostile Indians on the Upper Missouri that
prompted Hunt to abandon his boats on July 18 at the
Arikara villages and proceed on dry land. From this point
on the expedition consisted of 82 horses, 62 men, and the
squaw and two children belonging to the interpreter Pierre
Dorion.</p>

<p class="caption">Fort Astoria.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The hopeful caravan retraced the route that Hoback
and his companions had followed across the trackless plains
and the Bighorn Mountains, then started up Wind River.
Here, on September 14, according to Irving&rsquo;s <b>Astoria</b>, the
guides</p>
<blockquote>
<p>assured Mr. Hunt that, by following up Wind River, and
crossing a single mountain ridge, he would come upon the
head waters of the Columbia. The scarcity of game, however,
which already had been felt to a pinching degree,
and which threatened them with famine among the sterile
heights which lay before them, admonished them to change
their course. It was determined, therefore, to make for a
stream [Green River] which, they were informed, passed
the neighboring mountains to the south and west, on the
grassy banks of which it was probable they would meet
with buffalo. Accordingly about three o&rsquo;clock on the following
day, meeting with a beaten Indian road which led
in the proper direction, they struck into it, turning their
backs upon Wind River.</p>
<p>In the course of the day they came to a height that commanded
an almost boundless prospect. Here one of the
guides paused, and, after considering the vast landscape
attentively, pointed to three mountain peaks glistening
with snow [the Tetons], which rose, he said, above a fork
of Columbia River. They were hailed by the travellers
with that joy with which a beacon on a sea-shore is hailed
by mariners after a long and dangerous voyage....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a buffalo hunt on the &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; or Green River, the
Astorians crossed the dividing ridge to the head of the
Hoback River (presumably then named in honor of their
guide), which they followed into Jackson&rsquo;s Hole.</p>
<p>The Hunt cavalcade paused at the confluence of the
Hoback and the Snake rivers, and debated. &ldquo;Should they
abandon their horses, cast themselves loose in fragile barks
upon this wild, doubtful, and unknown river; or should they
continue their more toilsome and tedious, but perhaps more
certain wayfaring by land?&rdquo; After some tentative exploring
of the Snake River Canyon, and upon the advice of the
three hunters, they wisely decided in favor of the latter
course. They forded the Snake, and on October 5 as they
crossed &ldquo;the mountain [Teton Pass] ... by an easy and
well-beaten trail, snow whitened the summit....&rdquo; On the
8th they arrived at Andrew Henry&rsquo;s abandoned post. Here
Hoback, Robinson, Reznor, and two others left the party on
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
a separate exploring trip; and here it was that Hunt yielded
to the demands of his followers, which he previously had
resisted, and abandoned his horses in favor of passage by
canoe flotilla down the Snake, a tragic mistake which
brought great suffering to the Astorians before they reached
their goal.</p>
<p>While the main body passed on, four men remained in
Jackson&rsquo;s Hole to &ldquo;catch beaver.&rdquo; This was the first known
actual trapping of that area. Even more important, it was
the first actual step in the great commercial project of
Astoria. Irving recognized the significance of this move:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The expedition] had now arrived at the head waters of
the Columbia, which were among the main points embraced
by the enterprise of Mr. Astor. These upper streams were
reputed to abound in beaver, and had as yet been unmolested
by the white trapper. The numerous signs of
beaver met with during the recent search for timber gave
evidence that the neighborhood was a good &lsquo;trapping
ground.&rsquo; Here then it was proper to begin to cast loose
those leashes of hardy trappers, that are detached from
trading parties, in the very heart of the wilderness. The
men detached in the present instance were Alexander
Carson, Louis St. Michel, Pierre Detaye, and Pierre
Delaunay.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig18">
<img src="images/img017.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="539" />
<p class="caption">Snake River crossing.<span class="jr"> Photo by Author</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>These men were instructed to &ldquo;trap upon the upper part
of Mad (Snake) River, and upon the neighboring streams.&rdquo;
Whether they entered Yellowstone Park at this time is
entirely conjectural. In the spring of 1812 they were attacked
by Crow Indians near the Three Forks, and Detaye
was killed.</p>
<p>On June 29, 1812, seven men led by Robert Stuart left
Astoria carrying dispatches overland to Astor. The party
arrived at St. Louis on April 30, 1813. They were the first
organized transcontinental expedition eastbound after the
return of Lewis and Clark, and the first to discover South
Pass and the great Platte or Central route which was destined
to become the main highway of the covered-wagon
migrations. This journey again took them through Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole.</p>
<p>Stuart had gone out to Astoria by sea, but his fellow
travelers had all been members of the Hunt expedition.
These were John Day, Benjamin Jones, Francois Leclerc,
Andre Valle, Ramsay Crooks, and Robert McClellan. Soon
after setting out up the Columbia River John Day became
violently deranged because of his sufferings from the previous
winter and had to be sent back to Astoria. To the six
remaining travelers, however, was eventually added Joseph
Miller, who had been with Hoback, Robinson, and Reznor
after they left Hunt in October 1811. The Stuart party
reached Bear River intending to go due east; but there Crow
Indians got on their trail. To elude them Stuart went north
to the Snake and thus struck Hunt&rsquo;s route of the preceding
year. At Snake or &ldquo;Mad River&rdquo; near the present Idaho-Wyoming
boundary, Crows stampeded their horses. They
built a raft and descended the Snake for over a hundred
miles, then crossed over the Snake River Range to Pierre&rsquo;s
Hole at the foot of the &ldquo;Pilot Knobs,&rdquo; where they reached
familiar territory.</p>
<p>Here, in order to avoid a chance encounter with a Blackfoot
war party, Stuart kept to the foothills, but the cantankerous
McClellan, complaining of sore feet, refused to
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
detour and went his own way. He was not to be seen again
for thirteen days. Crooks, who had been ailing for some
time, fell desperately ill, and despite recourse to castor oil
and &ldquo;an Indian sweat,&rdquo; tied up the expedition in Pierre&rsquo;s
Hole for four days. On October 5 they set out again and
on the 7th crossed &ldquo;the summit of Pilot Knob Mountain
[Teton Pass]&rdquo; and reached the east bank of &ldquo;Mad River.&rdquo;
Their stock of venison was by this time depleted. On the
9th they started up the precipitous Hoback Canyon and on
the 12th reached Green River drainage, where they found
McClellan. Warding off starvation by slaughtering an &ldquo;old
rundown buffalo bull,&rdquo; the travelers journeyed from here
to South Pass and down the Platte, wintering in the vicinity
of Scotts Bluff.</p>
<p>For a few years after Stuart&rsquo;s party disappeared up
Hoback Canyon, the Tetons and Jackson&rsquo;s Hole were left
in solitude. Due to the hostility of the Blackfeet, the loss
of Astoria in the War of 1812, and the indifference of the
Federal Government, American interest in the Western Fur
trade suffered a relapse. British interests now took the
initiative. In 1816 the Northwest Company, licensed by the
Crown to trade in Oregon, put Donald McKenzie in charge
of the Snake River division. From Fort Nez Perce at the
mouth of the Walla Walla, he set forth in September of
1818 at the head of an expedition &ldquo;composed of fifty-five
men, of all denominations, 195 horses and 300 beaver traps,
besides a considerable stock of merchandise.&rdquo; He reported
his course to Alexander Ross:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this place [the &ldquo;Skamnaugh&rdquo; or Boise] we advanced,
suffering occasionally from alarms for twenty-five days,
and then found ourselves in a rich field of beaver, in the
country lying between the great south branch and the
Spanish waters [Bear River?].... I left my people at the
end of four months. Then taking a circuitous route along
the foot of the Rocky Mountains, a country extremely
dreary during a winter voyage, I reached the head water
of the great south branch regretting every step I made that
we had been so long deprived of the riches of such a
country....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a description of the Snake River country, presumably
furnished him by McKenzie, Ross continues:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>

<img src="images/img018.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="457" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;The British Threat&rdquo;&mdash;Exhibit in Fur Trade Museum, Grand Teton National Park.</p>
</div>
<div class="box">
<p><b>For twelve years after the returning Astorians disappeared up the Hoback, no Americans
entered Jackson Hole. The British North West Company, and then the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
with which it merged, trapped unchallenged west of the Rockies.</b></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The Rocky Mountains skirting this country on the
East, dwindle from stupendous heights into sloping ridges,
which divide the country into a thousand luxurious vales,
watered by streams which abound in fish. The most remarkable
heights in any part of the great backbone of
America are three elevated insular mountains, or peaks,
which are seen at the distance of one hundred and fifty
miles: the hunters very aptly designate them the Pilot
Knobs they are now generally known as the Three Paps
or &lsquo;Tetons&rsquo;; and the source of the Great Snake River is in
their neighborhood....</p>
<p>Boiling fountains, having different degrees of temperatures,
were very numerous; one or two were so very hot
as to boil meat. In other parts, among the rocks, hot and
cold springs might alternately be seen within a hundred
yards of each other, differing in their temperature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McKenzie&rsquo;s exact route can only be conjectural, but the
context suggests passage through Jackson&rsquo;s Hole into a corner,
at least, of Yellowstone Park. It was apparently on
this occasion that the &ldquo;Trois Tetons&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pierre&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo;
were given their names by Iroquois or French-Canadians
who accompanied McKenzie.</p>
<p>Chittenden reports the discovery in 1880 by Colonel
P. W. Norris of a tree near the Upper Falls of the Yellowstone
with the inscription &ldquo;JOR Aug 19 1819.&rdquo; Although of
course the initials prove nothing as to identity, Chittenden
accepts this as proof of white men in the Park at that time.</p>
<p>Stimulated by McKenzie&rsquo;s success in acquiring peltries,
the Northwest Company followed up with other Snake River
expeditions. The threat of British domination of Oregon
was aggravated when, in 1821, the Northwest Company was
absorbed by the powerful Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company.</p>
<p>Shortly after the consolidation of the British companies,
the prospects for a revival of American interest in the
mountain fur trade were awakened in the frontier town of
St. Louis by the formation of a partnership that would
evolve into the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. In 1822
General William H. Ashley and the veteran Major Andrew
Henry enlisted the aid of &ldquo;one hundred young men to ascend
the Missouri River to its source&rdquo; on a trapping expedition.
Among those who joined the enterprise, then or subsequently,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
were men destined to make history in the West&mdash;James
Bridger, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Jedediah Smith, William
Sublette and David E. Jackson. They were green boys,
hardly fit material for an epic invasion of the uncharted
Rocky Mountains; yet they were destined to become continental
explorers.</p>
<p>Henry took his young men in keelboats up the Missouri
to the mouth of the Yellowstone, where they spent the
winter. In the spring of 1823 he set out for the Blackfoot
country to the west. Again, as in 1810, these Indians proved
to be most inhospitable, scalping four of his recruits and
driving him back to his fort. Meanwhile General Ashley
organized another expedition and proceeded upriver without
incident until he arrived at the villages of the Arikara.
There his plans were upset by a treacherous attack in which
thirteen of his men were killed and many others were
wounded. Colonel Leavenworth hastened to the rescue,
but his campaign against the Indians was something of a
fiasco. Soon afterward Ashley returned to St. Louis, Henry
returned to his post on the Yellowstone, and a third contingent
started overland under the command of Jedediah
Smith. In February 1824 this last group made the first
crossing of South Pass from east to west, their discovery of
rich beaver fields in Green River Basin opening a new era
in fur trade history. In June they split into four parties.
Fitzpatrick, heading east for Fort Atkinson to report the
situation to Ashley, rediscovered the Platte route of the
returning Astorians; Sublette, Bridger, and others went
southwest to explore the Bear River country and lay claim
to the discovery of Great Salt Lake; and Smith, with six
unidentified companions, went north. The details of their
course are given in Washington Hood&rsquo;s <b>Original draft of a
report of a practicable route for wheeled vehicles across the
mountains</b>, written at Independence, August 12, 1839.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After striking the Colorado, or Green river, make up the
stream toward its headwaters, as far as Horse creek, one of
its tributaries, follow out this last mentioned stream to its
source by a westerly course, across the main ridge in order
to attain Jackson&rsquo;s Little Hole, at the headwaters of Jackson&rsquo;s
fork [Hoback River]. Follow down Jackson&rsquo;s fork
to its mouth and decline to the northward along Lewis&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
fork [Snake River], passing through Jackson&rsquo;s Big Hole
to about twelve miles beyond the Yellowstone pass [sic],
crossing on the route a nameless beaver stream. Here the
route passes due west over another prong of the ridge
[Conant Pass], a fraction worse than the former, followed
until it has attained the headwaters of Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, crossing
the Big Teton, the battleground of the Blacksmith&rsquo;s
fork; ford Pierre&rsquo;s fork eastward of the butte at its mouth
and Lewis fork also, thence pass to the mouth of Lewis
fork.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently the Smith party encountered a Hudson&rsquo;s
Bay Company brigade under Alexander Ross, giving first
notice that Americans would actively contest British claims
to Oregon. This expedition to the Jackson&rsquo;s Hole country
was also significant as the first in an amazing series which
has established Jedediah Smith as perhaps the foremost
explorer of Western America.</p>
<p>We have noted the visit of McKenzie&rsquo;s brigade of British-Canadians
to the Upper Snake and a region of boiling fountains,
in 1818-1819, as reported by Ross. Now, in 1824, Ross
himself conducted the second British invasion of Yellowstone
Park, while crossing from Okanagon to the headwaters
of the Missouri. In the foolscap folios which make up his
official report, the entry for April 24 reads: &ldquo;We crossed
beyond the Boiling Fountains. The snow is knee-deep half
the people are snow-blind from sun glare.&rdquo; So British
traders have supplied the first clear record of Yellowstone
thermal wonders to follow the hazy notations along Colter&rsquo;s
route on The Clark Map of 1810.</p>

<h2 id="c6">VI. &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo;: Era of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, 1825-1832</h2>
<p>Late in 1824 General Ashley, journeying west to reap
the winter&rsquo;s harvest of furs, approached the mountains by
way of the little-known South Platte route and the Colorado
Rockies and explored the lower Green River. In the summer
of 1825 on Henry&rsquo;s Fork of the Green (near the
Wyoming-Utah line) he inaugurated the annual rendezvous
of the mountain trappers, which provided a more flexible
system of fur trading than the &ldquo;fixed fort system&rdquo; which
had hitherto prevailed in the Western fur trade. The beaver
catch brought in this first year was of such magnitude that
Ashley was assured of a substantial profit. With Smith
and a strong guard he took his prize by pack train to the
Bighorn, by bullboats to the mouth of the Yellowstone, and
by keelboats down the Missouri River to St. Louis.</p>
<p>Jedediah Smith left Flathead House in 1825 with Peter
Skene Ogden of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, but left him
in time to rejoin his comrades at the rendezvous. When
the reunited Americans exchanged tales of their adventures,
it is possible that Smith offered a glowing account of the
Jackson&rsquo;s Hole region. Whatever the inspiration, Bridger
and Fitzpatrick are reported to have headed there to resume
trapping operations, after seeing Smith and Ashley safely
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
down the Bighorn. This may have been the first large-scale
trapping venture in which Jackson&rsquo;s Hole was a primary
objective.</p>
<p>The rendezvous of 1826 took place near Great Salt Lake.
The turnover of furs was immense and, having made his
fortune, General Ashley sold his interests to three of his
most able employees, Jedediah Smith, David E. Jackson, and
William Sublette. Smith left the rendezvous to lead a band
southwest across the desert to the Spanish settlements of
California, being the first to make this perilous passage.
Jackson and Sublette headed for the Snake River country
to trade with the Flatheads, taking a large force of trappers.</p>
<p>Daniel T. Potts of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,
one of Sublette&rsquo;s men on this expedition, is now identified
as the long-mysterious author of the letter which first appeared
in the Philadelphia <b>Gazette and Daily Advertiser</b>,
September 27, 1827, reprinted in <b>Niles&rsquo; Register</b> of October 6,
which contains the earliest known description of any portion
of present Yellowstone National Park by an American. The
original document came to light in 1947 when Mrs. Kate
Nixon and Miss Anne G. Rittenhouse of Washington, D. C.,
collateral descendants of Potts, made themselves known to
officials of the National Park Service. It has been fittingly
acquired for posterity by the Yellowstone Library and Museum
Association at Mammoth Hot Springs. The cover is
addressed to &ldquo;Mr. Robert T. Potts, High Street, Philadelphia&rdquo;
and stamped &ldquo;St. Louis, Missouri.&rdquo; Dated July 8, 1827, at
the &ldquo;Sweet Lake&rdquo; or Bear Lake (Utah) rendezvous, it describes
how the Potts party, no members of which are identified,
went north after the Salt Lake rendezvous of 1826:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few dass sinci our trader arived by whom I received
two letters one from Dr. Lukens the other from yourself
under date of January 1827 which gives me great congratulation
to hear that you are both happy wilst I am unhappy
also to hear from my friends shortly after writing to you
last year I took my departuri for the Black-foot Country
much against my will as I could not maki a party for any
other rout. We took a northerly direction about fifty miles
where we cross Snake River or the South fork of columbia
at the forks of Henrys &amp; Lewis&rsquo;s forks at this place we
was dayly harrased by the Black-feet from thence up
Henrys or North fork which bears North of East thirty
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
miles and crossed a large ruged Mountain which sepparates
the two forks from thence East up the other fork to its
source which heads on the top of the great chain of Rocky
Mountains which sepparates the water of the Atlantic from
that of the Pacific. At or near this place heads the Luchkadee
or Calliforn Stinking fork Yellow-stone South fork
of Massuri and Henrys fork all those head at an angular
point that of the Yellow-stone has a large fresh water lake
near its head on the verry top of the Mountain which is
about one hundrid by fourty miles in diameter and as clear
as crystal on the south borders of this lake is a number of
hot and boiling springs some of water and others of most
beautiful fine clay and resembles that of a mush pot and
throws its particles to the immense height of from twenty
to thirty feet in height The clay is white and of a pink
and water appear fathomless as it appears to be entirely
hollow under neath. There is also a number of places
where the pure suphor is sent forth in abundance one of
our men Visited one of those wilst taking his recreation
there at an instan the earth began a tremendious trembling
and he with dificulty made his escape when an explosion
took place resembling that of thunder. During our stay
in that quarter I head it every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From here, probably the West Thumb thermal area, &ldquo;by
a circutous rout to the Nourth west&rdquo; and after some more
bloody encounters with the Blackfeet, the trappers moved
toward the Bear Lake rendezvous. In 1828 Potts left the
hostile mountains and embarked from New Orleans on a
cattle ship, which sank with all hands in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>At the 1827 rendezvous at Bear Lake Jedediah Smith
appeared like a ghost out of the Great Salt desert, reporting
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
that the Spanish Governor of California had expelled him
from that province. He arranged with his partners, Jackson
and Sublette, to meet two years hence &ldquo;at the head of
Snake River.&rdquo; Then, after a rest of only ten days, he
summoned volunteers and again set his face toward the
Pacific Ocean. In the winter of 1827-28, while Sublette
attended to the business of getting supplies from St. Louis,
Jackson sent fur brigades north from Bear Lake to the
Snake River and its tributaries, where they came in frequent
contact with the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company trappers under
Ogden. In 1828 the rendezvous was again Great Salt Lake,
and again the trappers dispersed to hunting grounds on
the Bear, the Snake, and the Green.</p>

<p class="caption">Keelboat up the Missouri.</p>
</div>
<p>In March 1829 William Sublette left St. Louis for the
mountains with a heavily laden pack train and 60 men, including
a novice of 19 named Joseph L. Meek, whose life
story, as told to Mrs. F. F. Victor, is a prime source of information.
After the general rendezvous, which that year
was held in July on the Popo Agie River northeast of South
Pass, Captain Sublette sent a brigade under his brother,
Milton Sublette, to the Bighorn Basin, then set out with the
main party, including Meek, Bridger, and Fitzpatrick, for
the upper Snake River Valley at the foot of the Tetons, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
point of reunion with his partners which had been agreed
upon two years previously. The episode which followed,
one of the treasured traditions of the Western fur trade,
is described in Mrs. Victor&rsquo;s <b>River of the West</b>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sublette led his company up the valley of the Wind
River, across the mountains, and on to the very headwaters
of the Lewis or Snake River. Here he fell in with
Jackson, in the valley of Lewis Lake, called Jackson&rsquo;s Hole,
and remained on the borders of this lake for some time,
waiting for Smith, whose non-appearance began to create
a good deal of uneasiness. At length runners were dispatched
in all directions looking for the lost Booshway.</p>
<p>The detachment to which Meek was assigned had the
pleasure and honor of discovering the hiding place of the
missing partner, which was in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, a mountain
valley about thirty miles long and of half that width, which
subsequently was much frequented by the camps of the
various fur companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/img021a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="383" />
<p class="caption">Arikara attack on Ashley Party, 1823.</p>
</div>
<p>This is the core of the tradition. From this it has
generally been inferred that it was on this occasion that the
lake and the valley were named in honor of David E. Jackson,
and that this was Captain Sublette&rsquo;s idea. David E.
Jackson, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Davey,&rdquo; is the mystery
man of the Smith-Jackson-Sublette trio. How old he was,
what he looked like, where he came from prior to 1823 is
not known. He was one of the &ldquo;enterprising young men&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
who responded to Ashley&rsquo;s call in that year. That his
&ldquo;rating&rdquo; with trappers was high and that he was one of the
acknowledged leaders of the Rocky Mountain fur trade is
clear from the fact of the partnership formed in 1826. He
was not illiterate, for his signature appears on documents,
but like most of his associates he kept no diary, so that our
knowledge of his exact wanderings is indistinct. It is part
of the tradition that he spent the winter of 1828-29 in the
vicinity of Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, and his known interest in the
region prompts us to believe that he had spent several previous
years there as well. He might well have been one of
the six men who accompanied Smith on his &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of
Jackson Hole in 1824. He left the mountains in 1830, went
to Santa Fe and then on to California on a trading venture
in 1831, and apparently returned to St. Louis in 1832, where
he disappears, so to speak, under a cloud. One rumor has
it that he &ldquo;ran off with property belonging to the firm of
Jackson, Waldo and Young,&rdquo; another that &ldquo;he dissipated his
large and hard-earned fortune in a few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the reunion in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, according to Meek,
the entire company moved up Henry&rsquo;s Fork of the Snake,
and across the Divide to the valleys of the Madison and
Gallatin. Crossing the Gallatin Range in early winter, the
trappers reached the vicinity of Cinnabar Mountain, three
miles below Yellowstone Park&rsquo;s present North Entrance.
Here two men were killed and the party was scattered by
the Blackfeet. Meek alleges that he wandered into the
future Park, where he ascended a high peak. Crossing
Yellowstone River, he ran into an incredible region smoking
&ldquo;like Pittsburgh on a winter morning&rdquo; with the vapor from
boiling springs, haunted by the sound of whistling steam
vents, dotted with cone-shaped mounds surmounted by craters
from which issued &ldquo;blue flames and molten brimstone,&rdquo;
and devoid of living creatures. From here, apparently the
seldom visited Mirror Plateau, Meek crossed the Absaroka
Range to the winter camp on Powder River.</p>
<p>About the first of April 1830, according to Meek, &ldquo;Jackson,
or &lsquo;Davey,&rsquo; as he was called by his men, with about
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
half the company, left for the Snake country.&rdquo; At the Wind
River rendezvous in July, &ldquo;Jackson arrived from the Snake
country with plenty of beaver....&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Wind River, on August 4, 1830, Smith, Jackson, and
Sublette, having earned a deserved fortune from their labors,
decided to retire from the mountain trade, and sold their
interest to a group of their employees who had already
distinguished themselves in the service&mdash;James Bridger,
Thomas Fitzpatrick, Milton Sublette, Henry Fraeb, and Baptiste
Gervais. The main trapper band, numbering over two
hundred and including Meek, followed Bridger and Fitzpatrick
northward to the Three Forks of the Missouri, thence
south to Ogden&rsquo;s Hole, a small valley in the Bear River
Mountains. In the fall of 1830, John Work, heading the
annual Snake River expedition of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
got wind of the American invasion of his domain.
Among other rumors was one that Fontenelle and his men
&ldquo;have been hunting on the Upper Snake. They were set
upon by the Blackfeet on the Yellowstone River and 18 men
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1831, after wintering again at Powder
River, Meek reports on the spring hunt: &ldquo;Having once more
visited the Yellowstone, they turned to the south again,
crossing the mountains into Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, on to Snake river;
thence to Salt river; thence to Bear river; and thence to
Green river to rendezvous.&rdquo; Confirmation of this comes
from Joseph Meek&rsquo;s brother Stephen, who says that this
year he trapped on the Yellowstone, Wind, and Musselshell
Rivers, &ldquo;going through Jackson&rsquo;s Hole to the rendezvous on
Popyoisa River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Powder River encampment Fitzpatrick headed
for St. Louis to round up a supply caravan. Running into
his old companions Smith, Jackson, and Sublette en route to
Santa Fe, he was persuaded to join them, being promised
an outfit when they arrived. Thus he shared the delays
and perils of that expedition in which Jedediah Smith was
slain by a Comanche spear, and when he left Santa Fe, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
was far behind schedule. Picking up young Kit Carson and
other volunteers at Taos, he followed the east slope of the
Rockies into eastern Wyoming country, sometime during
September reaching the North Platte River at Laramie&rsquo;s
Fork. Here he met Fraeb, who had been sent to look for
him while the others waited impatiently with parched
tongues at Green River. Fitzpatrick returned to St. Louis
for supplies, while Fraeb led the recruits westward, traveling
via Green River and Jackson&rsquo;s Hole to &ldquo;winter quarters
on the head of Salmon River.&rdquo; Thus there was no real
summer rendezvous in 1831.</p>
<p>At this time the shadow of the American Fur Company,
the great monopoly of the Upper Missouri region, fell across
the Rocky Mountains. In February 1830 the newly organized
&ldquo;Western Department&rdquo; of this company, determined to
capture the lucrative mountain trade, sent out an expedition
from St. Louis under Andrew Drips, Lucien Fontenelle and
one Robidoux. Our chief source of information about this
company during the early 1830&rsquo;s is the journal of Warren A.
Ferris. From an encampment near the Big Hole country of
Montana, Ferris writes: &ldquo;On the 8th [of October, 1831] two
of our men accompanied by three or four Indians departed
for the Trois Tetons, to meet Mr. Dripps who was expected
this fall from the Council Bluffs, with an equipment of men,
horses, and merchandise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From spring camping grounds on the Bear and Snake
River tributaries, the brigades of the rival companies converged
on Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, where the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company partners had scheduled their rendezvous for 1832.
Although they welcomed peaceful Indians and &ldquo;free&rdquo; trappers,
they expressly did not invite their competitors of the
American Fur Company who, nevertheless decided to attend.
Rumors of the impending conclave of the &ldquo;mountain men&rdquo;
also reached the scattered bands of independent trappers,
among whom was George Nidever. In the spring Nidever&rsquo;s
band trapped up the Green River until May, intending to
continue on to &ldquo;the head waters of the Columbia,&rdquo; but
turned back when they learned that &ldquo;the place we intended
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
going was already being trapped by other companies.&rdquo; (This
strongly suggests that somebody, probably Rocky Mountain
men, were trapping in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole prior to the rendezvous.)
Returning to the Platte River, they met &ldquo;O&rsquo;Felon&rdquo;
and Moses &ldquo;Black&rdquo; Harris, two other independent traders,
with whom they proceeded by way of Teton Pass to the
rendezvous, where they arrived on July 4.</p>
<p>The experienced William Sublette, one-time partner,
had contracted with the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to
supply trade goods, and to take out the beaver hides. With
Robert Campbell he set out for St. Louis in May 1832 with
over 100 men. At Independence he picked up a band of
eighteen green New Englanders under Nathaniel J. Wyeth,
an ambitious young man who had hopes of succeeding,
where John Jacob Astor had failed, in establishing a fur-trading
empire in Oregon. At Laramie&rsquo;s Fork he recruited
some twenty trappers under Alfred K. Stephens, and other
trappers were picked up farther on. Not the least remarkable
feature of this expedition was that at least five of its
members kept notes&mdash;William Sublette, the methodical
Nathaniel Wyeth, his brother John B. Wyeth, another of his
followers named John Ball, and Zenas Leonard, one of the
&ldquo;free&rdquo; trappers with Stephens.</p>
<p>Sublette&rsquo;s account is contained in a letter to General
Ashley, dated Lexington, Missouri, September 21, 1832. He
indicates that he arrived at the head of the &ldquo;Colorado of
the West&rdquo; (Green River) on July 2, being attacked that night
by Blackfoot Indians; arrived &ldquo;on the waters of the Columbia&rdquo;
July 4 &ldquo;and at the rendezvous of the Rocky Mountain
Hunters, on the Columbia river, west of the Three Teton
Mountains,&rdquo; on July 8. Nathaniel Wyeth&rsquo;s diary agrees substantially
with Sublette on chronology, but is much more
illuminating. He clearly depicts the dangerous descent of
the Hoback, the fording of &ldquo;Lewis River&rdquo; on July 6, and the
climb up Teton Pass, &ldquo;a gap of the mountains due south of
the Trois Tetons.&rdquo; The disillusioned brother, John Wyeth,
gives us a dramatic picture:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>On the 4th [6th?] of July, 1832, we arrived at Lewis&rsquo;s
fork [Snake River], one of the largest rivers in these rocky
mountains. It took us all day to cross it. It is half a mile
wide, deep and rapid. The way we managed was this:
one man unloaded his horse, and swam across with him,
leading two loaded ones, and unloading the two, brought
them back, for two more, and as Sublet&rsquo;s company and our
own made over a hundred and fifty, we were all day in
passing the river. In returning, my mule, by treading on
a round stone, stumbled and threw me off, and the current
was so strong, that a bush which I caught hold of only
saved me from drowning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Broken Hand&rdquo; Fitzpatrick became &ldquo;White Hair&rdquo; Fitzpatrick
as a result of events which befell him in 1832. Zenas
Leonard states that in June 1832 while he was encamped at
Laramie&rsquo;s Fork:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick and a company of 115 men came to our
camp. He was on his way [from St. Louis] to join his
company on the west side of the mountains, on the Columbia
River, and to supply them with merchandise, ammunition,
horses, etc....</p>
<p>Having made this arrangement with Mr. F., our camp
[on the Laramie] was all confusion at an early hour this
morning, preparing to depart for the Columbia river. Mr.
F. took one of the fleetest and most hardy horses in his
train, and set out in advance of the main body, in order to
discover the disposition of the various Indian tribes through
whose dominions we were to travel, and to meet us at a
designated point on the head of the Columbia river.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While en route to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, probably in the valley
of Green River, Fitzpatrick was ambushed by or stumbled
upon the hostile Gros Ventres, probably the same who later
raided Sublette&rsquo;s camp. By sacrificing his horse and secreting
himself in a hole in the rocks, he managed to elude these
savages, but nearly starved while wandering through the
wilderness. Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s whereabouts during his ordeal are
not recorded, and in most accounts he merely turns up (on
July 8, according to Ferris) in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole in a pitiful state.
Meek relates that &ldquo;he made his appearance in camp in company
with two Iroquois half-breeds, belonging to the camp,
who had been out on a hunt,&rdquo; which is also the way that
Irving got it from Bonneville. George Nidever claims to
have been one of these hunters, and, if his story is straight,
Fitzpatrick was found in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole: &ldquo;A week or so
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
after the arrival of the company a trapper by the name of
Poe and I went out for a short hunt, and met Fitzpatrick
crossing the Lewis Fork.... We piloted him back to camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the 17th of July the whiskey kegs were all empty,
and the wild celebration which invariably climaxed every
rendezvous of the fur traders perforce came to an end in
Pierre&rsquo;s Hole. On this day the combined companies of
Nathaniel Wyeth and Milton Sublette set out for the lower
Snake River. On the morning of the 18th they described a
column of Gros Ventre tribesmen descending a hillside,
&ldquo;fantastically painted and arrayed, with scarlet blankets
fluttering in the wind.&rdquo; The ensuing conflict was a victory
for the trappers. Some of the Indians escaped from their
improvised fort into Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, leaving perhaps twenty-six
of their number dead, while their trail of blood suggested
other heavy casualties. This battle upset the general time-table
and delayed the various departures from the rendezvous.
On the 24th of July, Wyeth and Milton Sublette resumed
their journey which had before been so rudely interrupted,
Wyeth eventually continuing on to visit the British
establishments on the Pacific Coast. Captain Sublette
was compelled to linger because of his injuries, and, on the
25th, seven who planned to accompany him to St. Louis
became impatient and started out by themselves. These
were Joseph More of Boston, one of Wyeth&rsquo;s deserters, a Mr.
Foy of Mississippi, Alfred K. Stephens, &ldquo;two grandsons of
the celebrated Daniel Boone,&rdquo; and two others unidentified.
In Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, apparently near the mouth of the Hoback,
they were ambushed by a band of Gros Ventres. More and
Foy were killed instantly, while Stephens died from his
wounds after he and the four survivors retreated with tiding
of disaster to Sublette&rsquo;s camp.</p>
<p>On July 30 Bridger and Fitzpatrick led the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company brigades northward from Pierre&rsquo;s
Hole toward the headwaters of the Missouri, while William
Sublette found himself sufficiently recovered to assist
Campbell in organizing the homeward-bound caravan, composed
of sixty men and a beaver-laden packtrain. According
to Irving, &ldquo;they chose a different route through the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
mountains, out of the way, as they hoped, of the lurking
bands of Blackfeet. They succeeded in making the frontier
in safety.&rdquo; It seems evident that the Sublette caravan turned
north after crossing the Snake and then ascended the Gros
Ventre River and crossed over to Wind River by way of
Union Pass. While the Sublette caravan was leaving the
valley, they were shadowed by a &ldquo;large body of the Blackfoot
tribe,&rdquo; doubtless the murderers of More and Foy, who
showed a healthy respect for the heavily armed trappers.
Thus it would seem that, while he did not entirely elude the
Blackfeet, Sublette managed to bluff his way past them and
avoid what might well have become the &ldquo;Battle of Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Pierre&rsquo;s Hole rendezvous, Drips and Vanderburgh,
the American Fur Company partisans, were frustrated
in their competitive effort by the fact that their
supply train under Fontenelle had failed to arrive. It was
now too late to bid for the furs taken out by Sublette, but
they might follow Bridger and Fitzpatrick with profit if
they only had trade goods. Accordingly, they resolved to
hasten to Green River to see if they could find the belated
caravan. The clerk, Warren A. Ferris, gives a detailed account
of the passage through &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Big Hole,&rdquo; in early
August:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the evening we halted on a spring, four miles east of
Lewis River, after marching twenty-two miles. On the
5th we passed six or eight miles southeast, and halted on
the margin of the stream [Hoback], flowing from that
direction. During our march, some of the hunters saw
the bones of two men, supposed to be those killed from a
party of seven, in the latter part of July....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After losing one horse in precipitous Hoback Canyon, the
party reached Jackson&rsquo;s Little Hole, where they killed several
buffalo, and successfully by-passed a large village of
Indians. They crossed over to Green River, and on the 8th
fell in with Fontenelle, &ldquo;who had passed from St. Louis to
the mouth of the Yellowstone in a steamboat, and thence
with pack horses to this place.&rdquo; Ferris accompanied Vanderburgh
and Drips on the return trip in pursuit of Bridger.
He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>On the 14th we passed through the Narrows, between
Jackson&rsquo;s Holes; and avoided some of the difficulties we
met on our previous passage, by crossing the river, several
times. In the evening we halted for the night near the
remains of two men, who were killed in July last. These
we collected, and deposited in a small stream, that discharged
itself into a fork of the Lewis river; that flows
from Jackson&rsquo;s Little Hole.</p>

<p class="caption">Rendezvous scene.</p>
</div>
<p>Captain Benjamin L. E. Bonneville, a Frenchman of
distinguished antecedents, applied in 1831 for a leave of
absence from the U.S. Army for the joint purpose of exploration
and trade. With funds provided by hopeful New
York capitalists he organized an impressive company, including
110 men and twenty ox-drawn wagons, and on
May 1, 1832, he set out from Fort Osage. Bonneville&rsquo;s wagon
train was the second to ascend the traditional overland route
along the Platte and the Sweetwater, and the first to cross
South Pass. In the Green River Valley on July 26 the
Captain was overtaken by Fontenelle&rsquo;s company. On the
west side of the Green, five miles above Horse Creek, he
started the erection of Fort Bonneville, while his rival encamped
farther upstream, for his jaded horses and mules
would budge no further. After Fontenelle&rsquo;s departure,
above noted, the Captain decided upon the advice of &ldquo;free
trappers,&rdquo; to head for Salmon River for the winter. Leaving
his cumbersome wagons at the fort, he cached most of his
baggage and then packed the rest on mules and horses. The
expedition set forth on August 22, reaching Teton Pass on
September 3. Instead of taking the standard route via the
Hoback, where hostile Indians waited in ambush, Captain
Bonneville elected to take a long circuitous route to the
headwaters of Green River, entering Jackson&rsquo;s Hole via the
Gros Ventre River.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Weapons of the Pierre&rsquo;s Hole Fight&rdquo;&mdash;Exhibit in Fur Trade Museum, Grand Teton National Park.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Following the rendezvous in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, the Rocky
Mountain men conducted their fall hunt in the dangerous
Blackfoot country around the Three Forks of the Missouri.
In attempting to follow them, Vanderburgh of the American
Fur Company was slain by the Blackfeet. During the winter
of 1832-33 the various rival bands holed up along tributaries
of the Snake and Salmon rivers; and at the first
melting of the snow they resumed their feverish scramble
for the prime hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Most of the other trapping bands remained west of the
Continental Divide to make their spring hunt, and approached
the Green River rendezvous through Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole. The first to stir in this direction was the American
Fur Company partisan Drips, who led the bulk of his forces,
probably about sixty men, up Snake River, hunting and
trapping as they went. At the junction of Salt River, they
were compelled to leave the Snake to make the toilsome
detour over the Snake River Range and Teton Pass, which
they reached on May 31. Ferris vividly describes their journey
through the &ldquo;immense banks of snow on the mountain,&rdquo;
the fording of &ldquo;Lewis River,&rdquo; and the ascent of &ldquo;Gros Vent&rsquo;s
Fork&rdquo; to the head of Green River. He notes, &ldquo;We found a
large herd of buffalo in the valley, and killed several; also
a large bear, which paid with his life the temerity of awaiting
our approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wyeth&rsquo;s enterprise on the Columbia River was balked
by the shipwreck of the vessel which was to supply him,
and, after a fruitless winter at Fort Vancouver, he set out
eastward with Francis Ermatinger of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company. Below the forks of the Snake they came up with
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
Captain Bonneville. The Wyeth journal tells the story of
their Jackson&rsquo;s Hole passage via Teton Pass and the Hoback.
He found &ldquo;horse flies on the mountains ... buffalo in the
bottom also mosquitoes.&rdquo; Evidence of the recent trail of
the &ldquo;men of Dripps and Fontenelle&rdquo; was observed, also the
place where More and Foy were killed the year before.
Of this passage Irving reports,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No accident of a disastrous kind occurred, excepting the
loss of a horse, which, in passing along the giddy edge of
a precipice, called the Cornice, a dangerous pass between
Jackson&rsquo;s and Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, fell over the brink, and was
dashed to pieces.</p>
<p>On the 13th of July [1833], Captain Bonneville arrived
at Green River....</p>

<h2 id="c7">VII. &ldquo;The Fire Hole&rdquo;: Era of the American Fur Company, 1833-1840</h2>
<p>By 1832 only fragments of the Yellowstone Park area
had apparently been explored, notably the Lake region.
According to Warren A. Ferris, one of the great geyser
basins was visited in the spring hunt of 1833 by a party of
forty men under a Spaniard named Alvaris (or Alvarez).
They reached the area by going up Henry&rsquo;s Fork, later returning
to Green River for the rendezvous. This is the first
concrete evidence of white men in the Firehole Basin. The
discoverer may have been Manuel Alvarez, United States
consul at Santa Fe from 1839 to 1846, who figures prominently
in Josiah Gregg&rsquo;s journal.</p>
<p>The rendezvous of 1833 was held at Bonneville&rsquo;s fort on
Horse Creek, tributary of Green River, near Daniel, Wyoming.
The St. Louis supply caravan of the Rocky Mountain
Fur Company, led by Robert Campbell, included young
Charles Larpenteur, who wrote in his journal of a side trip
through Jackson&rsquo;s Hole:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The day after we reached the rendezvous Mr. Campbell,
with ten men, started to raise a beaver cache at a
place called by the French Trou a Pierre, which means
Peter&rsquo;s Hole. As I was sick Mr. Campbell left me in camp,
and placed Mr. Fitzpatrick in charge during his absence,
telling the latter to take good care of me ... after seven
or eight days Mr. Campbell returned with ten packs of
beaver.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>An epidemic of hydrophobia brought on by &ldquo;mad
wolves&rdquo; seems to have contributed to the early break-up of
the 1833 meeting. Campbell, Wyeth, and the partners of
the Rocky Mountain Fur Company with fifty-five packs of
beaver and a strong guard circled down through South Pass
and up to the junction of the Shoshone and the Bighorn
rivers, where they embarked on bullboats for the mouth of
the Yellowstone. Here Wyeth was entertained at the palatial
Fort Union by the famous Kenneth McKenzie, and
observed a powder flask which had belonged to the unfortunate
More, and which had found its way here from
Jackson&rsquo;s Hole by the devious channels of the fur trade.</p>
<p>While Bonneville outfitted an expedition under Joseph
R. Walker to explore California (and discover Yosemite
Valley), the American Fur Company brigades headed for
the Snake River country. On July 20 Warren A. Ferris and
Robert Newell departed at the head of an outfit destined
for the Flathead trade. The little party consisted of six
&ldquo;engages&rdquo; with pack horses, and five armed Indians,
amounting in all to thirteen armed men. Their route was
the usual one via Hoback Canyon and Teton Pass. The
ecstatic description of Jackson&rsquo;s Hole from the summit of
the pass, given by Ferris on this occasion, is one which can
be appreciated by the modern tourist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... Gazing down in the direction of Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, from
our elevated position, one of the most beautiful scenes
imaginable, was presented to our view. It seemed quite
filled with large bright clouds, resembling immense banks
of snow, piled on each other in massy numbers, of the
purest white; wreathing their ample folds in various forms
and devious convolutions, and mingling in one vast embrace
their shadowy substance.&mdash;Sublime creations! emblems
apt of the first glittering imaginings of human
life!...</p>
<p>Turning with reluctance to things of a more terrestrial
nature we pursued our way down to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, where
we fortunately discovered and killed a solitary bull....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rendezvous of 1834 was scheduled for June on
Ham&rsquo;s Fork of the Green near present Granger, Wyoming;
and here converged all the scattered trapper bands, with
the exception of those in the pay of Bonneville, who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
his own private rendezvous on Bear River. Drips hunted
up the Snake River to Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, and apparently crossed
into the valley of the Green from there. Behind him came
Ferris. On his southward journey from Montana country,
Ferris decided to make a side trip from Henry&rsquo;s Fork to
investigate strange rumors concerning the upper Madison,
a trip which resulted in the second known published description
of the Yellowstone Park wonders.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">

<p class="caption">Fort Hall.</p>
</div>
<p>Ferris, a native of New York who later resided in Texas,
made his first western journey with the American Fur Company
in 1830. Hardly a typical mountain man, he kept a
journal of his travels entitled &ldquo;Life in the Rocky Mountains,&rdquo;
which appeared serially in 1842 and 1843 in the
<b>Western Literary Messenger</b>, an obscure weekly published
in Buffalo, New York. The piece containing an account of
his visit to the geyser region in 1834 appeared on July 13,
1842, attracted no special attention at the time except that
of the editors of the Nauvoo, Illinois, <b>Wasp</b>, who ran it without
credit in their edition of August 13, 1842. Olin D.
Wheeler discovered it and republished it in 1901. Its historical
importance as the first adequate description of the
geysers by an eyewitness (and the second published description
of any portion of Yellowstone Park) was appreciated by
Chittenden, but his identity and the magnificent scope of
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
his journal was not fully understood until its republication
with extensive editorial notes by Dr. Paul C. Phillips in
1940. It was in May 1834, while his brigade was traveling
through Idaho country en route to the rendezvous on Ham&rsquo;s
Fork of the Green, that Ferris and two Indian companions
made a hurried side trip, going almost due east forty miles.
His object was to verify the rumors concerning &ldquo;remarkable
boiling spring on the sources of the Madison&rdquo; which he had
heard at the rendezvous of 1833. He soon realized that &ldquo;the
half was not told me.&rdquo; A fragment of his vivid description
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the surface of a rocky plain or table, burst forth
columns of water, of various dimensions, projected high in
the air, accompanied by loud explosions, and sulphurous
vapors, which were highly disagreeable to the smell. The
rock from which these springs burst forth, was calcareous,
and probably extends some distance from them, beneath
the soil. The largest of these wonderful fountains, projects
a column of boiling water several feet in diameter, to the
height of more than one hundred and fifty feet&mdash;in my
opinion; but the party of Alvarez, who discovered it, persist
in declaring that it could not be less than four times that
distance in height&mdash;accompanied with a tremendous noise.
These explosions and discharges occur at intervals of about
two hours.</p>

<p>After this adventure, he returned to Henry&rsquo;s Fork and
thence to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, crossing Teton Pass on May 24. In
the Hoback Canyon he found evidence that a party under
Drips had preceded him.</p>
<p>Less well known than the vivid description by Ferris
but even more remarkable is his &ldquo;Map of the Northwest
Fur Country,&rdquo; drawn in 1836. Lying in the family trunk
for over a century, unknown to geographers and historians,
it was made available in 1940 for publication with the
journals. This is, to quote Dr. Phillips, &ldquo;the most detailed
and accurate of all the early maps of the region,&rdquo; far superior
in accuracy to the famous maps by Bonneville,
Parker, John C. Fremont, and others which were published
contemporaneously. In addition to mountain chains, valleys,
and trails, it locates such fascinating details as &ldquo;Yellow
stone L.,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boiling water,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volcanoes&rdquo; near the south
shore of the lake and &ldquo;spouting fountains&rdquo; within the &ldquo;Burnt
Hole&rdquo; at the head of Madison River, indicating the present
West Thumb thermal area and the Upper Geyser Basin on
Firehole River, respectively. The context of the journal,
together with the evidence of the map, suggests that Ferris
beheld and described Old Faithful, the geyser which has
become the symbol of Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>In August of 1834 a party of fifty-five men in Bonneville&rsquo;s
employ led by Joseph H. Walker ascended Pacific
Creek from Jackson&rsquo;s Hole and after some debate &ldquo;agreed
to move down onto Wind River,&rdquo; instead of descending the
Yellowstone. Thus Walker, who had previously discovered
Yosemite Valley, and Zenas Leonard, the journalist of the
expedition, missed the big exploring opportunity which
Ferris had grasped.</p>
<p>The quaint nomenclature bestowed on certain locales
and landmarks by the mountain trappers offer more than
one clue to their shadowy passage. The Gardner River
Valley at Swan Lake Flats, between Mammoth Hot Springs
and Obsidian Cliff, seems to be the most likely locale of the
beaver-rich &ldquo;Gardner&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo; frequented by the mountain
men, probably named for Johnson Gardner, a freelance trapper
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
who must have frequented those parts at least as early
as 1834, possibly as early as 1830 as Chittenden suggests.
His name appears in the Fort Union account books of 1832,
which include an agreement to purchase his stock of beaver
skins then cached on Yellowstone River. In 1834 he fell in
with Prince Maximilian of Wied on the Lower Missouri,
revealing to that distinguished traveler that &ldquo;he was on his
return from hunting beavers on the Upper Yelowstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three significant events occurred in connection with
the rendezvous of 1834. (1) En route from St. Louis, Sublette
and Campbell began the building of Fort Laramie
(originally Fort William) on the North Platte. (2) Nathaniel
Wyeth, embarking on a second venture, brought in trade
goods which were not accepted, and so resorted to the establishment
of Fort Hall near the junction of the Snake and
Portneuf. The advent of these two fixed trading posts
prophesied an end to the traditional rendezvous system.
Also (3), at the rendezvous the partnership of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company was dissolved, Fraeb and Gervais
selling out their interests. The remaining partners&mdash;Fitzpatrick,
Bridger, and Milton Sublette&mdash;formed a new firm,
but they made an agreement with Fontenelle which gave
the American Fur Company a virtual monopoly of the Rocky
Mountain fur trade.</p>
<p>Among those whom Nathaniel Wyeth had left at Fort
Hall in 1834 was a young man named Osborne Russell, whose
subsequent career as a trapper was hardly typical, for
among his trapping accessories were copies of Shakespeare
and the Bible! Although later a prominent pioneer of
Oregon and California, his claim to fame rests on his <b>Journal
of a Trapper</b>, which &ldquo;as a precise and intimate firsthand
account of the daily life of the trapper explorer ... has no
equal,&rdquo; except that of Warren A. Ferris, who left the mountain
scene just as Russell arrived. On the 15th of June 1835
a party of fourteen trappers and ten camp keepers was
made up. Writes Russell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here we again fell on to Lewis&rsquo; Fork, which runs in a
southerly direction through a valley about eighty miles
long, there turning to the mountains through a narrow cut
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
in the mountain to the mouth of Salt River, about thirty
miles. This valley was called &lsquo;Jackson Hole.&rsquo; It is generally
from five to fifteen miles wide. The southern part
where the river enters the mountains is hilly and uneven,
but the northern portion is wide, smooth and comparatively
even, the whole being covered with wild sage and surrounded
by high and rugged mountains upon whose summit
the snow remains during the hottest months in summer. The
alluvial bottoms along the river and streams intersecting
it through the valley produced a luxuriant growth of vegetation,
among which wild flax and a species of onion were
abundant. The great altitude of this place, however, connected
with the cold descending from the mountains at
night, I think would be a serious obstruction to the growth
of most kinds of cultivated grains. This valley, like all
other parts of the country, abounded with game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a nearly disastrous attempt to cross &ldquo;Lewis Fork&rdquo; by
bullboat and raft, the party discovered a ford, and then
ascended Gros Ventre Fork. The party became lost in the
mountains for several weeks, missing out on the Green River
rendezvous. After extricating themselves from the craggy
wilderness of the Absarokas, the party reached the Lamar
River or East Fork of the Yellowstone, where they encountered
some woebegone Sheepeater Indians, and lost a hunter.
They apparently forded the Yellowstone at the lower end
of the Grand Canyon near the mouth of Antelope Creek, at
a point just above the spectacular Tower Falls and the
Basaltic Cliffs where the river &ldquo;rushes down a chasm with
a dreadful roar echoing among the mountains.&rdquo; From
&ldquo;Gardner&rsquo;s Hole&rdquo; the party then crossed the mountains to
Gallatin and Madison forks, where they fell in with a trapping
brigade under Bridger. Just below the Madison Canyon
the combined forces were attacked by eighty Blackfeet
and narrowly escaped massacre.</p>
<p>The supply caravan under Fitzpatrick arrived at the
Green River rendezvous on August 12, 1835. Accompanying
him were two famous missionaries&mdash;Marcus Whitman, who
distinguished himself among the trappers by extracting an
Indian arrow from the back of Captain Bridger, and Reverend
Samuel Parker, who alienated them by his overzealous
moralizing. However, Parker made quite a hit with the
assembled Flatheads and was so enthusiastic over their
eagerness for Christian knowledge that it was decided that
he would accompany them to their homes, while Whitman
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
would return to the states to recruit help for a permanent
mission in Oregon. Parker tells of his journey westward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August 21st, commenced our journey in company with
Capt. Bridger, who goes with about fifty men, six or eight
days&rsquo; journey on our route. Instead of going down on the
southwest side of Lewis&rsquo; river, we concluded to take our
course northerly for the Trois Tetons, which are three very
high mountains, covered with perpetual snow, separated
from the main chain of the Rocky Mountains, and are seen
at a very great distance; and from thence to Salmon
river....</p>
<p>On the 22d ... we ... arrived at what is called
Jackson&rsquo;s Hole [Jackson&rsquo;s Little Hole]....</p>
<p>Sabbath, 23d. Had an opportunity for rest and devotional
exercises. In the afternoon we had public worship
with those of the company who understood English. The
men conducted with great propriety, and listened with
attention....</p>
<p>Arose very early on the 24th, and commenced our
way through the narrow defile, frequently crossing and
recrossing a large stream of water [Hoback] which flows
into the Snake river....</p>
<p>... on the 25th, [we] encamped in a large pleasant
valley, commonly called Jackson&rsquo;s large hole. It is fertile
and well watered with a branch of Lewis&rsquo; river coming
from the southeast [Hoback], and another of some magnitude
coming from the northeast [Snake River itself], which
is the outlet of Jackson&rsquo;s lake, a body of water situated
just south of the Trois Tetons....</p>
<p>We continued in this encampment three days, to give our
animals an opportunity to recruit, and for Captain Bridger
to fit and send out several of his men into the mountains
to hunt and trap....</p>
<p>On the 28th, we pursued our journey and passed over
a mountain [Teton Pass] so high, that banks of snow were
but a short distance from our trail. When we had ascended
two-thirds of the way, a number of buffalo, which
were pursued by our Indians, came rushing down the side
of the mountain through the midst of our company....</p>
<p>In [Pierre&rsquo;s Hole] ... I parted with Captain Bridger
and his party, who went northeast into the mountains to
their hunting ground, which the Blackfeet claim, and for
which they will contend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the impious Joseph L. Meek, the sermon
on Sunday the 23rd in Jackson&rsquo;s Little Hole (the site of
which has been memorialized by the State of Wyoming as
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
that of &ldquo;the first Protestant sermon in the Rocky Mountains&rdquo;)
was not such a great success as Parker makes out,
for, &ldquo;in the midst of the discourse, a band of buffalo appeared
in the valley, when the congregation broke up,
without staying for a benediction,&rdquo; and every man excitedly
joined in the hunt.</p>

<p class="caption">Marcus Whitman removing arrow from Jim Bridger.</p>
</div>
<p>Another who accompanied this expedition was Kit Carson.
Parker gave Carson his initial shove into immortality
by relating the story of his victory at the rendezvous over
a &ldquo;great bully&rdquo; named Shunar:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>

<p class="caption">Trappers at Old Faithful.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>... I will relate an occurrence which took place near
evening, as a specimen of mountain life. A hunter, who
goes technically by the name of the great bully of the
mountains, mounted his horse with a loaded rifle, and
challenged any Frenchman, American, Spaniard, or Dutchman,
to fight him in single combat. Kit Carson, an American,
told him if he wished to die, he would accept the
challenge. Shunar defied him. C. mounted his horse, and
with a loaded pistol, rushed into close contact, and both
almost at the same instant fired. C&rsquo;s ball entered S&rsquo;s hand,
came out at the wrist, and passed through the arm above
the elbow. Shunar&rsquo;s ball passed over the head of Carson;
and while he went for another pistol, Shunar begged that
his life might be spared. Such scenes, sometimes from
passion, and sometimes for amusement, make the pastime
of their wild and wandering life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another rendezvous was held for the summer of 1836,
again on Horse Creek tributary of Green River. Fitzpatrick
and Fontenelle arrived with the supply caravan on July 3.
With them were the missionaries Marcus Whitman and H. H.
Spalding, accompanied by their wives, the first white
women ever to attend a rendezvous of the mountain men
and doubtless the first to come within 100 miles of the
future Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks. At this meeting
Major Joshua Pilcher, as agent for the American Fur
Company, formally and legally took over the interests of
Bridger, Fitzpatrick, and Fontenelle, thus consolidating the
monopoly. The missionaries, accompanied by Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company agents, followed the Bear River route westward.
The fur trappers were left in the mountains with Drips,
Fontenelle, and Bridger. Says Osborne Russell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bridger&rsquo;s party, as usual, was destined for the
Blackfoot country. It contained most of the American
trappers and amounted to sixty men. I started with a
party of fifteen trappers and two camp keepers, ordered
by Mr. Bridger to proceed to the Yellowstone Lake and
there await his arrival with the rest of the party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Russell entered Jackson&rsquo;s Hole by way of the upper Green
and Gros Ventre rivers, followed the Snake River north to
Jackson Lake, and on August 7 started up Buffalo Fork, to
reach Two Ocean Pass. On August 13, he camped at the
inlet of Yellowstone Lake, and on the 16th &ldquo;Mr. Bridger
came up with the remainder of the party.&rdquo; They followed
along the eastern shore of the lake to its outlet at present
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
Fishing Bridge, and camped again &ldquo;in a beautiful plain
which extended along the northern extremity of the lake.&rdquo;
Russell describes the lake as &ldquo;about 100 miles in circumference
... lying in an oblong form south to north, or rather
in the shape of a crescent.&rdquo; His further description of the
boiling springs, hot steam vents, and the hollow limestone
crustation &ldquo;of dazzling whiteness,&rdquo; apparently in Hayden
Valley, ranks him with Potts and Ferris as a pioneer
journalist of the Park phenomena.</p>

</div>
<p>In 1837 Thomas Fitzpatrick again led the supply train
across the plains, picking up Fontenelle at Fort Laramie,
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
and arriving at the rendezvous on July 18. After the business
of that year was transacted, Drips returned east with
Fitzpatrick&rsquo;s caravan, and Fontenelle and Bridger made up
a strong company of 110 men to invade the hostile Blackfoot
country. Osborne Russell and five others started off separately
&ldquo;to hunt the headwaters of the Yellowstone, Missouri
and Bighorn Rivers.&rdquo; Going due north up Green River,
they were attacked by &ldquo;sixty or seventy&rdquo; Blackfeet, but
managed to escape to the rendezvous. Here they wisely
decided to throw in with Fontenelle&rsquo;s party, as Russell explains,
&ldquo;intending to keep in their company five or six days
and then branch off to our first intended route.&rdquo; After
descending the Hoback, Russell and three others left the
main party at the ford of &ldquo;Lewis Fork&rdquo; in &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Big
Hole&rdquo; and took the same route to Yellowstone Lake used
the preceding year, then went northeast over the mountains
to gain the &ldquo;Stinking Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spring of 1838 the company moved westward from
Powder River, trapping the Bighorn and other tributaries
of the Yellowstone. Russell and Meek report another fight
with the Blackfeet on the Madison, followed by a gathering
of the brigade on the north fork of the Yellowstone, near
the lake. Afterward, Meek reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bridger&rsquo;s brigade of trappers met with no other serious
interruptions on their summer&rsquo;s march. They proceeded
to Henry&rsquo;s Lake, and crossing the Rocky Mountains,
traveled through the Pine Woods, always a favorite region,
to Lewis&rsquo; Lake on Lewis&rsquo; Fork of the Snake River [Jackson
Lake]; and finally up the Grovant Fork, recrossing the
mountains to Wind River, where the rendezvous was appointed.</p>
<p>Osborne Russell describes this rendezvous of 1838:</p>
<p>... [July] 4th&mdash;We encamped at the Oil Spring on
Popo-azia, and the next day we arrived at the camp. There
we found Mr. Dripps from St. Louis, with twenty horse
carts loaded with supplies, and again met Captain Stewart,
likewise several missionaries with their families on their
way to the Columbia River. On the 8th Mr. F. Ermatinger
arrived with a small party from the Columbia, accompanied
by the Rev. John Lee, who was on his way to the United
States. On the 20th of July the meeting broke up and the
parties again dispersed for the fall hunt.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Captain Stewart referred to by Russell was an
English veteran of Waterloo, Sir William Drummond
Stewart, ostensibly a wealthy sportsman, who became a
perennial visitor to the annual conclaves of the &ldquo;mountain
men,&rdquo; beginning in 1833. He probably entered Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole on more than one occasion, in company with the trapper
bands, but of this there is no proof, except the following
passage to be found in <b>Altowan</b>, a romantic novel based on
his experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the banks of a small stream, which ultimately finds
its way into the upper waters of Snake River, a rugged
path, made by the bison descending from a pass above,
winds its way through the dwarf willows and quaking asp
that line its side ... on a sudden turn of the road round
a projecting cliff, Altowan stopped to contemplate the
scene below, which, though not new to him, is one of
undying wonder and magnificence. Far over an extensive
vale rise &lsquo;the three Tetons,&rsquo; high above surrounding mountains;
their peaked heads shine white against the azure
sky, while other ranges succeed each other like waves
beyond and beyond, until they merge into the purple haze
of the Western Horizon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By 1838, competition for beaver pelts was beginning to
exhaust the streams, and the law of diminishing returns was
making itself felt in the Rocky Mountain fur trade. Nevertheless,
after the rendezvous of that year, the field commanders
of the company assembled their trappers for another
invasion of the Jackson&rsquo;s Hole country. Again Osborne
Russell illuminates the scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started, with about thirty trappers, up Wind River,
expecting the camp to follow in a few days. During our
stay at the rendezvous it was rumored among the men that
the company intended to bring no more supplies to the
Rocky Mountains, and discontinue all further operations.
This caused a great deal of discontent among the trappers
and numbers left the party. 21st&mdash;We traveled up Wind
River about thirty miles and encamped. 22nd&mdash;Continued
up the river till noon, then left it to our right, traveled
over a high ridge covered with pines, in a westerly direction
about fifteen miles, and fell on to the Grosvent Fork.
Next day we traveled about twenty miles down Grosvent
Fork. 24th&mdash;Myself and another crossed the mountain in
a northwest direction, fell on to a stream running into
Lewis Fork, about ten miles below Jackson&rsquo;s Lake. Here
we staid and trapped until the 29th. Then we started back
to the Grosvent Fork, where we found the camp, consisting
of about sixty men, under the direction of Mr. Dripps, with
James Bridger pilot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The next day the camp followed down the Grosvent
Fork to Jackson&rsquo;s Hole. In the meantime myself and
comrade returned to our traps, which we raised, and took
over the mountain in a southwest direction and overtook
the camp on Lewis Fork. The whole company was starving.
Fortunately I had killed a deer in crossing the mountain,
which made supper for the whole camp. Aug. 1st&mdash;We
crossed Lewis Fork and encamped and staid the next
day. 3d.&mdash;Camp crossed the mountain to Pierre&rsquo;s Hole and
the day following I started with my former comrade to
hunt beaver on the streams which ran from the Yellowstone....</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig33">
<img src="images/img030.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="424" />
<p class="caption">Trapper train in Teton Pass.</p>
</div>
<p>Russell&rsquo;s side trip appears to have been made cross
country from near the Cottonwood Creek tributary of the
Gros Ventre over the foothills of Mt. Leidy to Spread Creek,
where he set traps, then back along this same route to
Bridger&rsquo;s camp on the Gros Ventre, then back to Spread
Creek, and later down the Snake River, rejoining the main
camp near the mouth of the Gros Ventre. Russell&rsquo;s account
of the main expedition fits in very well with the brief entry
in Newell&rsquo;s diary&mdash;&ldquo;up Wind River into Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, on
to Pier&rsquo;s Hole.&rdquo; Another trapper present was young Jim
Baker, famous Wyoming pioneer, who was making his first
visit to the mountains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>An entry in Russell&rsquo;s journal indicates that a party of
trappers from Fort Hall reached Yellowstone Lake in 1838.
Meek alleges that he went alone to Gardner&rsquo;s Hole after the
rendezvous and later to Burnt Hole, the neighborhood of
Hebgen Lake. Here he left a joking message on a buffalo
skull.</p>
<p>Some evidence of wintering in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole is given
by Robert Newell:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capt. Drips left in December for Wind River with his
camp. Capt. Walker remained on Green River with a
small party, where we are now. Snow about one foot.
January 26, 1839, buffalow scarce. I spent last Christmas
in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole. We spent the balance of the winter
down on Green River, over on Ham&rsquo;s Fork, the spring
commencing to open the first of March, 1839.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kit Carson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the return of Spring we commenced our hunt,
trapped the tributaries of the Missouri to the head of Lewis
Fork, and then started for the rendezvous on Green River,
near the mouth of Horse Creek....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In March, Meek, after wintering among the Nez Perces
on the Salmon River, and acquiring an Indian wife (apparently
his third), set out trapping again with a comrade
named Allen to whom he was much attached.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They traveled along up and down the Salmon, to Godin&rsquo;s
River, Henry&rsquo;s Fork of the Snake, to Pierre&rsquo;s Fork, and
Lewis&rsquo; Fork, and the Muddy, and finally set their traps
on a little stream that runs out of the pass which leads to
Pierre&rsquo;s Hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correlated with other data, the &ldquo;pass which leads to Pierre&rsquo;s
Hole&rdquo; sounds very much like Teton Pass. Here, according
to Victor, a horrible event occurred. Ambushed by Blackfeet,
Meek managed to escape in a thicket, but the hapless
Allen was caught, shot, and then gleefully dismembered
within sight and sound of his companion. Meek is supposed
to have wriggled away during the night and, &ldquo;after twenty-six
days of solitary and cautious travel,&rdquo; escaped to the place
of rendezvous.</p>

</div>
<p>Information on the rendezvous of 1839 has survived
through the account of F. A. Wislizenus, a German doctor
and political refugee, who accompanied the St. Louis supply
train in the interests of curiosity and recreation. In addition
to offering a vivid picture of proceedings at the rendezvous,
he also comments on the decline of the fur trade in the Rocky
Mountains. Wislizenus, Ermatinger of the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay
Company, the Munger-Griffin missionary party, and several
hundred Indians left the rendezvous for Fort Hall, going by
the Bear River route, which was soon to become a part of
the Oregon Trail. As for the trappers, it appears that some
of them, yielding to fate, disbanded, but Meek and Newell
were among those who went to Fort Hall and later trapped
around Brown&rsquo;s Hole (a valley made by the Green River
along the northern base of the Uinta Range). Others were
still attracted to Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, the heart of the prime
beaver country. An eminent pioneer of Montana, W. T.
Hamilton, got it from &ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the year 1839 a party of forty men started on an
expedition up the Snake River. In the party were Ducharme,
Louis Anderson, Jim and John Baker, Joe Power,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
L&rsquo;Humphrie, and others. They passed Jackson&rsquo;s Lake,
catching many beaver, and crossed the Continental Divide,
following down the Upper Yellowstone&mdash;Elk&mdash;River to the
Yellowstone Lake.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="img" id="fig35">
<img src="images/img031a.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="430" />
<p class="caption">Skinning beaver in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole.</p>
</div>
<p>This party was attacked by the Blackfeet near the outlet
of Yellowstone Lake, suffering a loss of five men. The
survivors, while trapping the Park, witnessed &ldquo;Sulphur
Mountain,&rdquo; the Mud Volcano, Yellowstone Falls at the head
of the Canyon, and the pyrotechnic displays of &ldquo;Fire Hole
Basin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early in 1839, Russell hunted mountain sheep and trapped
beaver along the Snake River below Jackson&rsquo;s Hole,
returning to Fort Hall in June. Making up a party of four
for the purpose of trapping in the Yellowstone and Wind
River Mountains, he spent the Fourth of July at the outlet
of Jackson Lake, near present Moran, then followed the
Snake River northward to Lewis Lake and Shoshone Lake.
The Shoshone Geyser Basin is described by Russell in meticulous
detail, including the rhythmic &ldquo;Hour Spring&rdquo; which
resembles present Union Geyser. From here they crossed
over to Hayden Valley via the Midway Geyser Basin, there
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
noting a &ldquo;boiling lake&rdquo; of deep indigo blue, about three hundred
feet in diameter, probably the present Grand Prismatic
Spring. After an extended camp at the outlet of Yellowstone
Lake they went east to the head of Clark&rsquo;s Fork,
thence back to the Yellowstone at the ford near Tower Falls,
thence to Gardner&rsquo;s Hole and back to the lake outlet. En
route they saw disturbing evidence of &ldquo;a village of 300 or
400 lodges of Blackfeet&rdquo; that had only recently been evacuated.
In their camp on Pelican Creek, just east of the present
Fishing Bridge campground, they were suddenly assailed
by a horde of &ldquo;70 or 80&rdquo; Blackfeet &ldquo;who rent the air with
their horrid yells&rdquo; and inflicted severe arrow wounds on
Russell and one other. They fought off the Indians with
their rifles, but suffered great pain and hardship in making
their way back to Fort Hall via West Thumb, Snake River,
Berry Creek and Conant Pass at the north end of the Teton
Range. This was Russell&rsquo;s final sorrowful exit from Wonderland.</p>
<p>Two slim and shaky clues to other Yellowstone expeditions
in the late 1830&rsquo;s are available. In his journal of 1839,
while sojourning in the Utah country, apprentice trapper
E. Willard Smith reports: &ldquo;The country around the headwaters
of the Yellowstone, a tributary of the Missouri,
abounds in natural curiosities. There are volcanoes, volcanic
productions and carbonated springs. Mr. Vasquez told me
that he went to the top of one of these volcanoes, the crater
of which was filled with pure water, forming quite a large
lake.&rdquo; In his <b>Life in the Far West</b> (1849), a fictionalized
account of the mountain men, with whom he had personally
consorted in 1846, Lieutenant Ruxton tells how, on one
occasion, Old Bill Williams, &ldquo;tough as the parfleche soles of
his moccasins,&rdquo; led seven of his hardy associates into a little-known
region, beckoned thence by &ldquo;a lofty peak&rdquo; which
fits the description of the Grand Tetons, entering &ldquo;the valley
lying about the lakes now called Eustis and Biddle, in which
are many thermal and mineral springs, well known to the
trappers by the name of Soda, Beer, and Brimstone Springs,
and regarded by them with no little awe and curiosity, as
being the breathing places of his Satanic majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The year 1840 can be said to mark the formal demise of
the Rocky Mountain fur trade, for in that year was held the
fifteenth and last of these great conclaves of the wilderness,
the trapper&rsquo;s rendezvous on Horse Creek of the Green River.
It also marks the end of an epoch in the history of Jackson&rsquo;s
Hole. The main chronicler of this fateful year was the
Belgian, Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit priest who accompanied
the American Fur Company&rsquo;s last expedition to the
mountains so that he might survey the prospects for a
Catholic mission among the Flathead Indians. This was the
beginning of a series of epic pilgrimages to the Far West
which were to make him one of the dominant figures in
American frontier history. Andrew Drips headed the supply
train. Also present were several Protestant missionaries
and &ldquo;the first avowed Oregon emigrant,&rdquo; Joel P. Walker,
and his wife and five children. On April 30, the caravan
left Westport, Missouri, and, after two months of traveling
over the Great Plains in the midst of vast buffalo herds, it
reached its destination. Writes Father De Smet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the 30th [June] I came to the rendezvous, where
a band of Flatheads, who had been notified of my coming,
were already waiting for me.... On the 4th of July, I
resumed my travels, with my Flatheads; ten brave Canadians
also chose to accompany me....</p>
<p>Three days we ascended Green river, and on the 8th
we crossed it, heading for an elevated plain which separates
the waters of the Colorado from those of the Columbia....
On leaving this plain, we descended several thousand feet
by a trail and arrived in Jackson&rsquo;s Hole [Jackson&rsquo;s Little
Hole].... Thence we passed into a narrow and extremely
dangerous defile, which was at the same time picturesque
and sublime....</p>
<p>On the 10th, after crossing the lofty mountain, we
arrived upon the banks of Henry&rsquo;s Fork [Snake River],
one of the principal tributaries of Snake [Columbia] river.
The mass of snow melted during the July heat had swollen
this torrent to a prodigious height. Its roaring waters
rushed furiously down and whitened with their foam the
great blocks of granite which vainly disputed the passage
with them. The sight intimidated neither our Indians nor
our Canadians; accustomed to perils of this sort, they
rushed into the torrent on horseback and swam it. I dared
not venture to do likewise. To get me over, they made a
kind of sack of my skin tent; then they put all my things
in and set me on top of it. The three Flatheads who had
jumped in to guide my frail bark by swimming, told me,
laughing, not to be afraid, that I was on an excellent boat.
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
And in fact this machine floated on the water like a
majestic swan; and in less than ten minutes I found myself
on the other bank, where we encamped for the night.</p>
<p>The next day we had another high mountain to climb
[Teton Pass] through a thick pine forest, and at the top
we found snow, which had fallen in the night to the depth
of two feet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joe Meek relates that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>about the last of June ... he started for the old rendezvous
places of the American Companies, hoping to find
some divisions of them at least, on the familiar camping
ground. But his journey was in vain. Neither on Green
River or Wind River, where for ten years he had been
accustomed to meet the leaders and their men, his old
comrades in danger, did he find a wandering brigade even.
The glory of the American companies was departed, and
he found himself solitary among his long familiar haunts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, this sad story does not fit in with De Smet&rsquo;s
account nor with the testimony of Meek&rsquo;s own good friend,
Robert Newell, who in June 1840 also left Fort Hall for the
rendezvous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ermatinger arrived 13th of June. I went to the
American rendezvous, Mr. Drips, Freab and Bridger from
St. Louis with goods, but times were certainly hard, no
beaver, and everything dull. Some missionaries came
along with them for the Columbia, Messrs. Clark, Smith,
Littlejohn. I engaged to pilot them over the mountains,
with their wagons and such used in crossing, to Fort Hall.
There I bought their wagons....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless Meek&rsquo;s memory was at fault, the discrepancy can
only be explained on the assumption that Meek, approaching
Green River by way of Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, simply did not look
hard enough. Be that as it may, Meek avers that after his
disappointed return to Fort Hall,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>he set out on what proved to be his last trapping expedition,
with a Frenchman, named Mattileau. They visited
the old trapping grounds on Pierre&rsquo;s Fork, Lewis&rsquo; Lake,
Jackson&rsquo;s [Hoback] River, Jackson&rsquo;s Hole, Lewis River
and Salt River: but beaver were scarce; and it was with
a feeling of relief that, on returning by way of Bear River,
Meek heard from a Frenchman whom he met there, that
he was wanted at Fort Hall, by his friend Newell, who
had something to propose to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>What Newell had to propose to Meek was something
revolutionary. On one of Newell&rsquo;s wagons Meek loaded
his traps and his Indian family, and together they performed
the historic feat of taking the first wagons through to the
Columbia River. Their departure best symbolizes the death
of the Rocky Mountain fur trade and the birth of the Oregon
Trail. After Meek&rsquo;s visit in 1840, Jackson&rsquo;s Hole relapsed
into virgin solitude. For twenty years thereafter there is
little positive evidence of white men in this valley. It was
forty-five years before the arrival of the first permanent
settler. For over a hundred years the historic importance
of Jackson&rsquo;s Hole as the continental crossroads of the Western
fur trade has been all but forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="c8">VIII. Epilogue: 1841-1870</h2>
<p>After 1840 Yellowstone Park was likewise virtually left
in primeval solitude. There is tangible evidence of only four
visits of white men during this period, and one attempted
visit which failed. In his recently published biography,
William Clark Kennerly has it that in 1843 a grand hunting
expedition headed by Sir William Drummond Stewart, and
including such notables as Sublette and Baptiste Charbonneau,
camped one evening among the geysers, having particularly
great sport in vain efforts to throttle &ldquo;old Steam
Boat.&rdquo; In 1844, according to Chittenden, a party of trappers,
identity not disclosed, entered Upper Yellowstone Valley
from the south, and &ldquo;passed around the west shore of Yellowstone
Lake to the outlet, where they had a severe battle
with the Blackfoot Indians, in a broad open tract at that
point. The remains of their old corral were still visible as
late as 1870.&rdquo; (This might be a variant of the same battle
of 1939, told by Hamilton.)</p>
<p>The remaining three expeditions were guided by James
Bridger, who in 1843 had set up Fort Bridger on Black&rsquo;s
Fork of Green River, to cater to the emigrants who were
beginning to follow the Oregon Trail. James Gemmell
claims to have been among those present in 1846 when
Bridger led &ldquo;a trading expedition to the Crows and Sioux,&rdquo;
north up the Green River through Jackson&rsquo;s Hole to West
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
Thumb, making a tour of the &ldquo;wonderful spouting springs&rdquo;
and other scenic features before continuing down the Yellowstone.
E. S. Topping states that in 1850 Jim Bridger,
Kit Carson, and twenty-two others on a prospecting trip
out of St. Louis &ldquo;crossed the mountains to the Yellowstone
and down it to the lake and the falls; then across the Divide
to the Madison River. They saw the geysers of the lower
basin and named the river that drains them the Fire
Hole.... The report of this party made quite a stir in St.
Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only historically discernible &ldquo;stir&rdquo; made by Bridger&rsquo;s
reports consisted of the usual incredulity and scoffing, exemplified
by the timidity of a Kansas City editor who in
1856 let immortality slip through his grasp by refusing to
publish Bridger&rsquo;s own version of &ldquo;the place where Hell
bubbled up.&rdquo; By this time, however, one notable Bridger
story had actually broken through the literary overcast,
and two more would soon appear to vindicate the famous
trapper. In 1852 Lieutenant Gunnison, who had been a
member of the Howard Stansbury exploring party which
Bridger guided to Great Salt Lake in 1849, published a
romantic but essentially accurate description of the principal
scenic features. Here is a &ldquo;lake, sixty miles long,&rdquo; a &ldquo;perpendicular
canyon,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Great Springs&rdquo; on successive terraces,
and &ldquo;geysers spouting seventy feet high.&rdquo; In his
letter mentioned above, published in 1863, constituting a
report on his participation in the Fort Laramie treaty council
of 1851, Father De Smet located what is substantially
the present Park &ldquo;in the very heart of the Rocky Mountains,
between the 43d and 45th degrees of latitude, and the 109th
and 111th degrees of longitude; that is between the sources
of the Madison and the Yellowstone,&rdquo; regarding it as &ldquo;the
most marvellous spot of all the northern half of the continent&rdquo;
because of its boiling springs, calcareous hills, escaping
vapors, steamboat noises, subterranean explosions and, near
Gardner River, &ldquo;a mountain of sulphur.&rdquo; In this case likewise
the source of his information was Bridger, &ldquo;who is
familiar with every one of these mounds, having passed
thirty years of his life near them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Even more illuminating to the historian than the well-known
De Smet letter are five unpublished maps traced by
that missionary. These maps had little contemporary influence
and, though noted by his biographers in 1905, they
have been neglected by subsequent historians. They are
documents of signal import, which should inspire renewed
respect for the ubiquitous Bridger and yet increase the
stature of the versatile and indefatigable De Smet, already
one of the giants of western history. Of these five maps
four are still at St. Louis University, which was his headquarters.
These are among dozens which were made by
him in the course of his several western journeys, the information
obtained by acute personal observation as well
as &ldquo;from trappers and intelligent Indians.&rdquo; The draftsmanship
of the first three, while not striking, is respectable.
One shows &ldquo;Yellow Stone&rdquo; River and tributaries as high as
&ldquo;Gardner&rsquo;s F.&rdquo; A second, embracing the Upper Missouri,
Yellowstone, and Upper Platte regions, shows a nameless
bladder-shaped lake at the head of the Yellowstone and a
conspicuous &ldquo;Hot Sulphur Spring&rdquo; north of the lake. A
third, embracing the entire West from the Great Basin to
the Forks of the Platte, shows essentially the same features.
The fourth map in the St. Louis collection is the most intriguing.
This depicts that remarkable twisted region of
the Rocky Mountains where the headwaters of the Yellowstone,
the Wind, the Green, the Snake, and the Missouri
rivers unwind before rolling to their respective oceans. The
undated map is crude and smeary, and it has all the ear-marks
of being sketched in the field without benefit of desk
or blotter. In view of De Smet&rsquo;s express testimony that
the most famous trapper of all supplied him with his geographic
data, at least for the &ldquo;Yellowstone Park&rdquo; section,
it is a fair guess that this was drawn by De Smet with
Bridger at his elbow. Here, on a rough chart consigned to
the oblivion of a library vault, is where &ldquo;Yellowstone Park&rdquo;
first comes into clear focus. Allowing for pardonable distortions,
all of the principal scenic features are in evidence:
the geyser basins of the Firehole (&ldquo;volcanic country&rdquo;); Mammoth
Hot Springs (&ldquo;Sulphur Mountain&rdquo; near &ldquo;Gardener&rsquo;s
Cr.&rdquo;); a shapeless Yellowstone Lake (&ldquo;60 by 9&rdquo;) with &ldquo;Hot
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
Springs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Great Volcanoes&rdquo; alongside; the Grand Canyon
and &ldquo;Falls 290 feet&rdquo;; and Hayden Valley (&ldquo;Volcanic
country [?] Steam Springs&rdquo;). Two Ocean Pass, Jackson
Lake, and &ldquo;Colter&rsquo;s Hell&rdquo; on Stinking River are other conspicuous
features near by.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Bridger Map&rdquo; is the obvious source of the Yellowstone
data found on the fifth De Smet map, embracing the
western United States, which is more carefully drawn than
the others. This large untitled map, with a bold floral
border, is dated 1851, and contains the following fading inscription
within curved palm fronds: &ldquo;respectfully presented
to Col. David D. [?] Mitchell [by] P. J. De Smet, Soc. Jes.&rdquo;
As to the circumstances under which this map was drawn,
De Smet explains as follows in a letter dated July 1, 1857,
to officials of the Department of the Interior:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was at the council ground in 1851, on the Platte
River, at the mouth of the Horse creek, I was requested
by Colonel Mitchell [superintendent of Indian Affairs at
St. Louis] to make a map of the whole Indian country,
relating particularly to the Upper Missouri, the waters of
the upper Platte, east of the Rocky mountains and of the
headwaters of the Columbia and its tributaries west of
these mountains. In compliance with this request I drew
up the map from scraps then in my possession. The map,
so prepared, was seemingly approved and made use of by
the gentlemen assembled in council, and subsequently sent
on to Washington together with the treaty then made with
the Indians. In my humble opinion, therefore, it can be
of very little service for your purposes, in which accuracy
of instrumental measurements and observation seems to
be absolutely necessary....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The final gesture of modesty may explain why this revealing
map, prepared and made available to the government
twenty years before the first official Park exploration got
under way, was duly glanced at by the department authorities
and then tucked away, a needle in the haystack of
official files, in Washington, D. C., where it still reposes.
It contains all the features of the &ldquo;Bridger Map,&rdquo; but with
refinements. Here is a &ldquo;Great Volcanic Region [?] now
in a state of eruption,&rdquo; drained by &ldquo;Fire Hole Riv.&rdquo; The
lake now appear as &ldquo;Yellowstone or Sublette&rsquo;s Lake,&rdquo; still
oddly sausage-shaped. There is a &ldquo;Little Falls&rdquo; at the head
of the canyon but the more impressive Lower Falls are
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
unexplainably omitted. To the southwest, in the position
of present Shoshone Lake, is &ldquo;De Smet Lake.&rdquo; To the east
at the forks of &ldquo;Stinking Fr.&rdquo; appears the &ldquo;Sulphur Springs
or Colter&rsquo;s Hell Volcano&rdquo; which, due to the unavailability
of this map, has led so many historians astray. This map,
with its manuscript forebears, ranks with the Ferris journal
and map and the Potts letter as one of the principal historical
documents pertaining to early Yellowstone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig38">

<p class="caption">Trappers in Pierre&rsquo;s Hole, west of &ldquo;Les Trois Tetons&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It is not evident that information given by Gunnison
and De Smet or any of their predecessors relative to unusual
phenomena on the Upper Yellowstone greatly impressed
representatives of the Federal Government. Certainly
no eagerness to verify these reports is betrayed in
the official instructions dated April 13, 1859, by which
Captain Raynolds, Corps of Topographical Engineers, was
directed &ldquo;to organize an expedition for the exploration of
the region of the country through which flow the principal
tributaries of the Yellowstone river, and of the mountains
in which they, and the Gallatin and Madison forks of the
Missouri, have their source.&rdquo; However, since one of the
objects of this exploration was to ascertain the principal
topographical features and since, moreover, the indispensable
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
Bridger was secured as a guide, it would seem that the
Yellowstone marvels were just about to be officially discovered
and proclaimed. Not so, however. The expedition
left winter camp on Platte River in May 1860. While a
detachment under Lieutenant Henry E. Maynadier went
north along the eastern slope of the Absaroka Range, the
main party ascended Wind River to Union Pass, then turned
north seeking the headwaters of the Yellowstone. Deep
snow and a great &ldquo;basaltic ridge&rdquo; blocked their efforts before
they reached Two Ocean Pass, and they had to satisfy themselves
with encircling the Park area via Jackson&rsquo;s Hole,
Teton Pass, Henry&rsquo;s Fork, and Raynolds&rsquo; Pass. By way of
the Madison, they rejoined Maynadier at the Three Forks.
Raynolds&rsquo; report and map became the first recognition by
the Federal Government of the possible existence of volcanic
activity in the region of the Upper Yellowstone. For information
regarding the &ldquo;burning plains, immense lakes, and
boiling springs&rdquo; and other unverifiable phenomena mentioned
he was, of course, indebted to his guide Bridger, with
trimmings added by Meldrum. On his &ldquo;Map of the Yellowstone
and Missouri Rivers,&rdquo; within the &ldquo;enchanted enclosure&rdquo;
which now constitutes Yellowstone National Park, the
soldier-explorer had the courage to place &ldquo;Yellowstone
Lake,&rdquo; &ldquo;Falls of the Yellowstone,&rdquo; &ldquo;Burnt Hole,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sulphur
Mountain,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elephant&rsquo;s Back Mt.,&rdquo; all now recognizable
features. This was an extraordinary demonstration of faith
in Bridger&rsquo;s veracity. Because of the Civil War, publication
of the report was delayed until 1868, but the map itself was
first issued separately a few years earlier.</p>
<p>It was the discovery of gold, first in California and
later in Colorado, which started the population moving centrally
westward in great numbers and diverted whatever
attention might otherwise have become focussed on the
Upper Yellowstone region. It was the discovery of gold in
western Montana which brought about its rediscovery and
early creation as the world&rsquo;s first National Park. Although
there was desultory prospecting previous to 1862, it was in
that year that the news of several major gold strikes was
broadcast and a full scale stampede to the diggings began.
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
In the spring of 1863 at least two prospecting parties entered
the Park. Although they were feverishly preoccupied with
the search for gold, the unusual character of the country
did not escape them entirely, and the leader of one party
made something akin to the first scientific eyewitness report.
This was Walter W. DeLacy, a professional surveyor.
In August 1863 he fell in with an expedition of forty-two
men bound for Snake River, and was elected captain. Their
search being unrewarded, fifteen of the party deserted at
Jackson Lake, the others deciding to push north. From the
junction of the Lewis and the Snake they went over the
Pitchstone Plateau to discover Shoshone Lake and Lewis
Lake. From there they crossed over the Divide to the
geyser basins of the Firehole. Although amazed at the
&ldquo;Steamboat Springs&rdquo; they had little time for sight-seeing,
and left the Park by way of the Gallatin. DeLacy&rsquo;s discoveries
were incorporated in his &ldquo;Map of the Territory of
Montana,&rdquo; which was published &ldquo;for the use of the First
Legislature of Montana&rdquo; in 1865. His accurate firsthand
knowledge of the western section of the Park is reflected
in the correct relationship of &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s Lake&rdquo; and unnamed
Lewis Lake and Shoshone Lake, and in the &ldquo;Hot
Spring Valley&rdquo; or geyser basin at the headwaters of the
Madison. Identifiable features of the unvisited eastern section
consist only of a misshapen &ldquo;Yellow Stone Lake&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have recognized the Ferris map of 1836 and the
De Smet map of 1851, based on the undated &ldquo;Bridger Map,&rdquo;
as the earliest authentic maps of the Yellowstone Park area,
but these remained unpublished and unheralded. The Raynolds
and DeLacy maps, though purporting to reveal the
scenic wonders, were scanned mainly by single-minded gold
seekers before they became obsolete. As to other contemporary
published maps, the persistence of this geographical
blind spot in the face of testimony offered by such prime
witnesses as Potts, Ferris, and Bridger is demonstrated by
the fact that for over half a century of map making by such
respected cartographers as John Arrowsmith, Albert Gallatin,
Bonneville, Fremont, and Gouverneur K. Warren there
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
was no improvement in the &ldquo;Yellowstone Park&rdquo; section of
the Clark map of 1810, with its &ldquo;Lake Eustis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hot
Spring Brimstone.&rdquo; There were only occasional meaningless
variations of nomenclature. For instance, on the Robert
Greenhow map of 1840 and on E. F. Beade&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Map of
the Great West,&rdquo; published in 1856, &ldquo;Hot Sulphur Springs&rdquo;
is substituted. On Charles Wilkes&rsquo; &ldquo;Map of Oregon Territory&rdquo;
which appeared in 1845 and on the J. H. Colton map
which accompanied <b>Horn&rsquo;s Overland Guide</b>, published in
1856, this phenomenon becomes &ldquo;Steamboat Sp.&rdquo; and Eustis
is transformed into &ldquo;Sublette&rsquo;s L.&rdquo; However, on the famed
Colton map of 1867, just five years before the first boat was
launched from its shores, the phantom lake&mdash;Eustis, Sublette,
or Yellowstone&mdash;has disappeared entirely!</p>
<p>Contemporary newspaper accounts and later published
reminiscences reveal several prospecting expeditions which
traversed the Park area during the period 1864-1869, but the
partial and foggy reports of &ldquo;a lost world&rdquo; given out by
these treasure hunters did little to dispel the curtain of
mystery stubbornly surrounding the area. The cumulative
effect of such reports and rumors, however, was destined
soon to convince intelligent listeners that no wild tale could
be so persistent, and that there must be something at the
headwaters of the Yellowstone worth looking into. In September
1869, David E. Folsom, Charles W. Cook, and William
Peterson packed south out of Diamond City, Montana, without
distracting thoughts of beaver hides or gold, but with
the express purpose of exploring that neighborhood and reporting
their findings without adornment. General Henry
D. Washburn, Hon. Cornelius Hedges, Hon. Nathaniel Langford,
Dr. Ferdinand V. Hayden, and Photographer William
H. Jackson were standing in the wings. The brief era of
definitive discovery was dawning.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
